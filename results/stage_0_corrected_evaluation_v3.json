We need to determine the truth values of P, Q, R, and S.\n\n---\n\n## Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n### Pratyaksha (Direct Perception)\n- None\n\n### Anumana (Inference)\n- From fact 1: If P is true, then Q is true. Since P is true (fact 4), Q must be true.\n- From fact 2: If Q is true, then R is true. Since Q is true (from fact 1), R must be true.\n- From fact 3: If R is true, then S is true. Since R is true (from fact 2), S must be true.\n\n### Upamana (Comparison)\n- None\n\n### Shabda (Testimony)\n- None\n\n---\n\n## Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n### Syllogism 1: \n**Pratijna (Thesis)**: P is true, Q is true, R is true, and S is true.\n**Hetu (Reason)**:\n- If P is true, then Q is true (fact 1)\n- If Q is true, then R is true (fact 2)\n- If R is true, then S is true (fact 3)\n**Udaharana (Universal + Example)**: All four facts are universal and logically connected.\n**Upanaya (Application)**: Applying the universal and logical connection, we conclude that P is true, Q is true, R is true, and S is true.\n**Nigamana (Conclusion)**: Therefore, the truth values of P, Q, R, and S are all true.\n\n---\n\n## Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Hypothesis**: Suppose P is false, Q is false, R is false, and S is false.\n**Consequence**: If P is false, then Q is false (by fact 1). If Q is false, then R is false (by fact 2). If R is false, then S is false (by fact 3). But we are given that P is true (fact 4). This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our hypothesis is false.\n**Analysis**: If we assume P is false, we get a contradiction. Therefore, P must be true.\n**Resolution**: Our hypothesis is false, so P is true.
