  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a quality control system that rejects a product based on certain test results. The condition for rejection is that the product is NOT the case where both Test-A and Test-B pass. In symbolic terms, that's Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). \n\nAlright, let me break this down. The system rejects the product if it's not the case that both tests pass. So, if either Test-A fails, or Test-B fails, or both, the product gets rejected. But if both tests pass, the product is accepted.\n\nNow, the specific case here is that Product P has passed Test-A but failed Test-B. So, Test-A is true, and Test-B is false. I need to figure out if Product P is rejected based on this.\n\nLet me write out the condition again: Rejected if \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, the negation of both tests passing. Let's compute that. If Test-A is true and Test-B is false, then Test-A \u2227 Test-B would be false because both have to be true for the conjunction. So, \u00ac(false) is true. Therefore, the condition for rejection is met because \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the logic here. The rejection condition is \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, if either Test-A is false, or Test-B is false, or both, then \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true. In this case, Test-A is true, Test-B is false. So, the conjunction Test-A \u2227 Test-B is false. The negation of that is true, so the product is rejected.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of logical implications. The rejection condition is equivalent to Test-A being false OR Test-B being false. Because \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB by De Morgan's laws. So, if either Test-A fails or Test-B fails, the product is rejected.\n\nIn this case, Test-A is true, so \u00acTest-A is false. Test-B is false, so \u00acTest-B is true. Therefore, \u00acTest-A \u2228 \u00acTest-B is false \u2228 true, which is true. Hence, the product is rejected.\n\nI don't see any exceptions here. The system's rule is straightforward: both tests must pass for the product to be accepted. If either test fails, regardless of the other, the product is rejected. So, in this case, since Test-B failed, the product is indeed rejected.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that the system could accept the product despite failing one test. But according to the condition, it's only accepted if both tests pass. There's no leeway for just one test passing. So, even if Test-A is passed but Test-B is failed, the product is still rejected.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through truth tables. Let's construct a truth table for Test-A (A), Test-B (B), and the rejection condition (\u00ac(A \u2227 B)).\n\n| A | B | A \u2227 B | \u00ac(A \u2227 B) |\n|---|---|-------|---------|\n| T | T |  T   |    F    |\n| T | F |  F   |    T    |\n| F | T |  F   |    T    |\n| F | F |  F   |    T    |\n\nLooking at the last column, \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is true in all cases except when both A and B are true. So, whenever either A is false, B is false, or both are false, the product is rejected. In our case, A is true, B is false. So, looking at the row where A=T and B=F, \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is true, meaning the product is rejected.\n\nI can't find any exceptions or special cases here. The rule is clear: both tests must pass. If either fails, the product is out. So, Product P, having passed Test-A but failing Test-B, doesn't meet both requirements, hence it's rejected.\n</think>\n\nThe product is rejected because it failed Test-B, making \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) true.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Product P is rejected.",
