  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Product P is rejected based on the given quality control system. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the system rejects a product if it's NOT the case that both Test-A and Test-B pass. In logical terms, that's written as Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, the product is rejected when either Test-A fails, or Test-B fails, or both.\n\nNow, the problem states that Product P has failed BOTH Test-A and Test-B. So, let's translate that into logic. If both tests fail, that means Test-A is false and Test-B is false. In logical terms, that's \u00acTest-A \u2227 \u00acTest-B.\n\nWait, the system's condition for rejection is \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). Let me think about the logical equivalence here. The negation of a conjunction (A \u2227 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB. So, \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is the same as \u00acTest-A \u2228 \u00acTest-B. That means the product is rejected if either Test-A fails, or Test-B fails, or both.\n\nSo, if both tests fail, then \u00acTest-A is true and \u00acTest-B is also true. Therefore, \u00acTest-A \u2228 \u00acTest-B would be true because either one is true. Hence, the product should be rejected.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. The system's rule is that the product is rejected if it's not the case that both tests pass. So, if both tests fail, it's definitely not the case that both pass. Therefore, the product is rejected.\n\nI don't see any exceptions mentioned here. The problem states that both tests failed, so there's no scenario where only one test fails and the other passes, which might complicate things. But in this case, both are failing, so the condition for rejection is clearly met.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since both Test-A and Test-B have failed, the product should be rejected by the quality control system.\n</think>\n\nYes, Product P is rejected because both Test-A and Test-B have failed, making it not the case that both tests pass. Therefore, the product does not meet the required quality standards and is rejected.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Product P is rejected.",
