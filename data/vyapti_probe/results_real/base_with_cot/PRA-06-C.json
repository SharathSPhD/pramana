  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\n\n1. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n2. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nCan we conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus?\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand what the given information is and what is being asked. The first statement is about Rishi owning a bicycle. The second statement is a general rule that all bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. The question is whether we can conclude that Rishi, specifically, lives within that same 5 km radius.\n\nAlright, so let me break this down. The second statement is a universal statement, meaning it applies to every bicycle owner without exception. So, if someone owns a bicycle, they must live within 5 km of the campus. Now, Rishi is a bicycle owner, as per the first statement. So, applying the second statement to Rishi, since he owns a bicycle, he must live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that this might not hold? Let me think. The second statement says \"all bicycle owners,\" which is a universal quantifier. So, in logic terms, it's like saying for all x, if x is a bicycle owner, then x lives within 5 km of the campus. So, if Rishi is a bicycle owner, then by the rule, he must live within 5 km. There's no exception mentioned here, so I don't think we can find a counterexample.\n\nLet me try to imagine a counterexample. Suppose there's someone who owns a bicycle but doesn't live within 5 km. But the second statement says all bicycle owners do live within 5 km, so such a person wouldn't exist. Therefore, Rishi, being a bicycle owner, must comply with that rule.\n\nAnother angle: Is there any hidden information or assumptions I'm missing? The problem doesn't mention anything else about Rishi's location or any exceptions. So, I think it's safe to conclude that yes, Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus based on the given statements.\n\nWait, but sometimes in logic, when you have a universal statement, you have to be careful about the domain. Here, the domain is all people, and the property is \"owning a bicycle.\" So, the statement is about all people in the domain who own bicycles. Since Rishi is in the domain and owns a bicycle, he must satisfy the property of living within 5 km.\n\nI don't see any logical loopholes here. The statements are straightforward. So, I think the conclusion is valid.\n</think>\n\nYes, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus. The given statements establish that all bicycle owners, including Rishi, reside within that distance from the campus, with no exceptions provided.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.",
