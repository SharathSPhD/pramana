You are also given a list of pairs (xi, yi) that represent the function's values at certain points. The function f is a polynomial of degree at most 2. So, f(x) can be written as f(x) = a x\u00b2 + b x + c, where a, b, c are constants.\n\nYour task is to determine the coefficients a, b, c of the quadratic function that fits the given points. If the points are colinear, the function is linear, i.e., a=0. If the points lie on a straight line, then it's a linear function, otherwise, it's quadratic.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. **Check if the points are colinear.** If they are, then the function is linear, so set a=0 and find b and c using two points.\n2. **If not colinear, then determine a, b, c using three points.**\n\nGiven the pairs (xi, yi):\n\nxi: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nyi: 2, 5, 9, 16\n\nSo, the points are (1,2), (2,5), (3,9), (4,16).\n\nLet me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the points are colinear. If they are, then it's a linear function. Otherwise, it's quadratic.\n\nTo check if the points are colinear, I can compute the slope between the first two points and then check if the slope between the second and third points is the same, and so on.\n\nSo, let's compute the slope between (1,2) and (2,5). The slope m1 is (5-2)/(2-1) = 3/1 = 3.\n\nNow, compute the slope between (2,5) and (3,9). m2 = (9-5)/(3-2) = 4/1 = 4.\n\nHmm, m1 is 3 and m2 is 4. Since they are not equal, the points are not colinear. Therefore, the function is quadratic, and we need to find a, b, c.\n\nSince it's a quadratic function, it can be written as f(x) = a x\u00b2 + b x + c.\n\nWe have four points, but a quadratic is determined by three points. So, we can pick any three points to set up a system of equations and solve for a, b, c. Alternatively, we can use all four points to find the best fit, but since it's a quadratic, three points should suffice.\n\nLet me choose the first three points: (1,2), (2,5), (3,9).\n\nPlugging each point into the quadratic equation:\n\nFor (1,2):\na(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 2\nWhich simplifies to:\na + b + c = 2  --> Equation 1\n\nFor (2,5):\na(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5\nWhich is:\n4a + 2b + c = 5  --> Equation 2\n\nFor (3,9):\na(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 9\nWhich becomes:\n9a + 3b + c = 9  --> Equation 3\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 2\n\n2) 4a + 2b + c = 5\n\n3) 9a + 3b + c = 9\n\nWe can solve this system step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\nEquation 2 - Equation 1:\n(4a - a) + (2b - b) + (c - c) = 5 - 2\n3a + b = 3  --> Equation 4\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\nEquation 3 - Equation 2:\n(9a - 4a) + (3b - 2b) + (c - c) = 9 - 5\n5a + b = 4  --> Equation 5\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n4) 3a + b = 3\n\n5) 5a + b = 4\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n\n(5a - 3a) + (b - b) = 4 - 3\n\n2a = 1\n\nSo, a = 1/2\n\nNow, plug a = 1/2 into Equation 4:\n\n3*(1/2) + b = 3\n\n3/2 + b = 3\n\nb = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2\n\nSo, b = 3/2\n\nNow, plug a and b into Equation 1:\n\n(1/2) + (3/2) + c = 2\n\n(4/2) + c = 2\n\n2 + c = 2\n\nc = 0\n\nSo, the quadratic function is f(x) = (1/2)x\u00b2 + (3/2)x + 0\n\nSimplify: f(x) = (x\u00b2 + 3x)/2\n\nLet me check if this function fits all four points.\n\nFor x=1: (1 + 3)/2 = 4/2 = 2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nx=2: (4 + 6)/2 = 10/2 =5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nx=3: (9 + 9)/2 = 18/2 =9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nx=4: (16 + 12)/2 =28/2=14\n\nWait, the given y-value for x=4 is 16, but according to this function, it's 14. That's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong here.\n\nHmm, that means either I made a mistake in calculations or the function isn't quadratic. But wait, the points aren't colinear, so it should be quadratic. Maybe I made a mistake in solving the equations.\n\nLet me double-check the equations.\n\nEquation 1: a + b + c =2\n\nEquation 2:4a +2b +c=5\n\nEquation 3:9a +3b +c=9\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from 2: 3a +b=3 (Equation4)\n\nSubtract Equation2 from3:5a +b=4 (Equation5)\n\nSubtract Equation4 from5:2a=1 => a=1/2\n\nThen, 3*(1/2) +b=3 => 3/2 +b=3 => b=3/2\n\nThen, a +b +c=2 => 1/2 +3/2 +c=2 => 2 +c=2 =>c=0\n\nSo, f(x)= (1/2)x\u00b2 + (3/2)x\n\nTesting x=4: (1/2)(16) + (3/2)(4)=8 +6=14\n\nBut the given y is 16. So, the function doesn't fit the fourth point. That suggests that the function isn't quadratic, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but the points (1,2), (2,5), (3,9), (4,16) look familiar. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the y-values: 2,5,9,16\n\nThese are perfect squares: 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2,4\u00b2\n\nSo, f(x)=x\u00b2\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, f(4)=14, which is not 16. So, something's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nWait, if f(x)=x\u00b2, then for x=1,2,3,4, y=1,4,9,16. But the given points are (1,2), (2,5), etc. So, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is f(x)=x\u00b2 + something.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nGiven points: (1,2), (2,5), (3,9), (4,16)\n\nSo, y=2 when x=1, which is 1\u00b2 +1=2\n\ny=5 when x=2: 2\u00b2 +1=5\n\ny=9 when x=3:3\u00b2 +0=9\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe y=x\u00b2 +x.\n\nFor x=1:1+1=2 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nx=2:4+2=6 \u22605 \u274c\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the function is f(x)=x\u00b2 + something else.\n\nWait, let's compute the differences between consecutive y-values:\n\nFrom x=1 to 2:5-2=3\n\nFrom 2 to3:9-5=4\n\nFrom3 to4:16-9=7\n\nSo, the differences are 3,4,7.\n\nIf it were quadratic, the second differences should be constant.\n\nCompute second differences:\n\n4-3=1\n\n7-4=3\n\nSo, second differences are 1 and 3, which are not constant. Therefore, the function isn't quadratic? But that contradicts the initial assumption.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the function is a quadratic of degree at most 2, so it must be quadratic. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's try",
