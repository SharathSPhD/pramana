  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus based on the given statements. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given information:\n\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess.\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club.\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nAnd the question is: Can we conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus?\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to see if these statements logically lead to the conclusion that Rishi is within 5 km of the campus. Let me think about each statement and how they connect.\n\nStarting with statement 1: All members of the chess club can play chess. That seems pretty straightforward. It's a general rule about the chess club members. So, if someone is a member, they can play chess. But how does that relate to Rishi? Well, statement 2 says Rishi is a member of the chess club. So, combining 1 and 2, we can say that Rishi can play chess. That's a given, but does that help us with the conclusion? Maybe not directly, but it's good to note.\n\nMoving on to statement 3: Rishi owns a bicycle. So, Rishi has a bicycle. Now, statement 4 is crucial here: All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. So, if someone owns a bicycle, they must live within 5 km. Now, since Rishi owns a bicycle, does that mean Rishi must live within 5 km? That seems like a direct conclusion. Because if all bicycle owners live within 5 km, and Rishi is a bicycle owner, then Rishi must live within that area.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any possibility that Rishi could live outside 5 km? The statement says all bicycle owners live within 5 km, so if Rishi is a bicycle owner, he must be within that range. There's no exception mentioned, so I don't think we can assume otherwise.\n\nLet me think if there's any logical fallacy here. Am I assuming something that isn't necessarily true? The statements are all general, so as long as they apply to Rishi, the conclusion should hold. Since Rishi owns a bicycle and all bicycle owners live within 5 km, Rishi must live within 5 km.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Rishi is a chess club member (statement 2).\n- Therefore, Rishi can play chess (from statement 1).\n- Rishi owns a bicycle (statement 3).\n- All bicycle owners live within 5 km (statement 4).\n- Therefore, Rishi lives within 5 km.\n\nI don't see any exceptions or missing information. The statements are all universal, meaning they apply to all cases, so there's no situation where Rishi could be a bicycle owner but live outside 5 km. That would contradict statement 4.\n\nI think that's solid. So, yes, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus based on the given information.\n</think>\n\nYes, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Given Statements:**\n   - All members of the chess club can play chess. (Statement 1)\n   - Rishi is a member of the chess club. (Statement 2)\n   - Rishi owns a bicycle. (Statement 3)\n   - All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. (Statement 4)\n\n2. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 2, since Rishi is a member of the chess club, and Statement 1 states that all members can play chess, Rishi can play chess. (This links Rishi directly to the chess club's attributes.)\n   \n   - From Statement 3, Rishi owns a bicycle. \n   \n   - Statement 4 is a universal rule: Every bicycle owner resides within 5 km of the campus. Since Rishi owns a bicycle, this rule applies to him.\n   \n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Applying the universal rule (Statement 4) to Rishi (from Statement 3), it logically follows that Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus.\n\n**Final Answer:** Yes, Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.",
