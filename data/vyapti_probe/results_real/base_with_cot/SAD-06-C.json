  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this classification system with two rules. I need to figure out if Object Q is classified as Type-X. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Rule 1 says that an object is classified as Type-X if it has Feature-P. So, the main thing I need to check is whether Object Q has Feature-P.\n\nNow, looking at Rule 2, Feature-P is defined as having a surface temperature above 1000\u00b0C. So, Feature-P isn't just some arbitrary feature; it's specifically about temperature.\n\nObject Q's surface temperature is measured at 1200\u00b0C. Hmm, 1200\u00b0C is definitely above 1000\u00b0C. So, does that mean it has Feature-P?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The rules don't mention any exceptions or other conditions. Rule 1 is straightforward\u2014it's all about having Feature-P. Rule 2 clearly defines Feature-P based on temperature.\n\nIs there any possibility that having a temperature above 1000\u00b0C doesn't automatically give Feature-P? I don't think so. The rules don't say anything about other features or exceptions. It's purely based on temperature.\n\nSo, putting it together: Object Q has a temperature above 1000\u00b0C, which by Rule 2 means it has Feature-P. Then, by Rule 1, it should be classified as Type-X.\n\nI don't see any counterexamples here. If another object had the same temperature but wasn't classified, that would be a problem, but the rules don't suggest that. It's a direct definition.\n\nTherefore, I think Object Q does qualify as Type-X.\n</think>\n\nYes, Object Q is classified as Type-X. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Rule 1 Analysis:** The classification depends on whether Object Q has Feature-P.\n2. **Rule 2 Analysis:** Feature-P is defined as a surface temperature above 1000\u00b0C.\n3. **Object Q's Measurement:** Its surface temperature is 1200\u00b0C, which is above 1000\u00b0C.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since Object Q meets the criteria for Feature-P, it satisfies Rule 1 and is classified as Type-X.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Object Q is classified as Type-X.",
