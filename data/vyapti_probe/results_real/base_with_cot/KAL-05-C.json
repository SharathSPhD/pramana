  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Building W complies with the current building code. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the original building code from 2015 says that all residential buildings must have a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. So, before 2020, this was the rule.\n\nThen, in 2022, there was an amendment. The new rule states that all residential buildings constructed after 2020 must have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet. But buildings that were constructed before 2020 are \"grandfathered\" under the original code. That means they don't have to meet the newer 9-foot requirement.\n\nNow, Building W was constructed in 2018, which is before 2020. It has 8.5-foot ceilings. So, I need to check if it meets the current code.\n\nWait, the original code required 8 feet, and the amendment only affects buildings built after 2020. Since Building W was built in 2018, it's covered by the grandfather clause. That means it only needs to meet the original code's requirements, right?\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The original code requires 8 feet, and the building has 8.5 feet, which is higher than 8 feet. So, it's compliant with the original code. The amendment doesn't apply because it was built before 2020.\n\nIs there any other rule that might affect this? The problem doesn't mention any other amendments or additional requirements. So, I think the key point is that the grandfather clause allows pre-2020 buildings to keep the original standards.\n\nTherefore, Building W with 8.5-foot ceilings should comply because it meets the original 8-foot requirement and is grandfathered in, so it doesn't have to meet the higher 9-foot standard.\n</think>\n\nBuilding W complies with the current building code. It was constructed in 2018, before the 2020 cutoff, and thus is grandfathered under the original 2015 code, which requires a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. Since Building W's ceilings are 8.5 feet, they meet the original requirement. The 2022 amendment only affects buildings constructed after 2020, so it does not apply here. Therefore, Building W is compliant. \n\n**Answer:** Yes, Building W complies with the current building code.",
