  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this logic problem here with four researchers: Priya, Qadir, Ravi, and Sita. Each of them works in one of two labs: Lab-North or Lab-South. They also each have a favorite beverage, either coffee or tea. The problem gives me five pieces of information, and I need to figure out which lab Ravi works in.\n\nLet me list out the given information first to make it clearer:\n\n1. Priya works in Lab-North.\n2. Qadir works in Lab-South.\n3. Ravi drinks coffee.\n4. Sita works in Lab-North.\n5. Priya drinks tea.\n\nI need to find out where Ravi works. Since all the researchers are either in Lab-North or Lab-South, and each has a beverage preference, maybe I can figure out more about their lab assignments based on these preferences.\n\nLet me start by organizing the information. Maybe I can make a table or something to keep track.\n\nFirst, let's note down each person and their known attributes:\n\n- **Priya**: Works in Lab-North, Drinks Tea.\n- **Qadir**: Works in Lab-South, Beverage unknown.\n- **Ravi**: Drinks Coffee, Lab unknown.\n- **Sita**: Works in Lab-North, Beverage unknown.\n\nSo, from points 1 and 4, both Priya and Sita work in Lab-North. That means Lab-North has at least two people: Priya and Sita. Lab-South has at least one person: Qadir.\n\nNow, looking at the beverages: Priya drinks tea, and Ravi drinks coffee. So, we have at least two different beverages: tea and coffee. But since each person's beverage is either coffee or tea, and there are four people, we might have two people who drink coffee and two who drink tea, or maybe three and one, or some other distribution. But from the given info, only two are specified: Priya (tea) and Ravi (coffee).\n\nWait, actually, point 3 says Ravi drinks coffee, and point 5 says Priya drinks tea. So, that's two people: Ravi (coffee) and Priya (tea). So, the other two people, Qadir and Sita, their beverages are unknown. So, maybe Sita drinks coffee or tea, and Qadir as well.\n\nBut how does that help me figure out where Ravi works? Hmm.\n\nI know that each lab has two people. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the size of the labs. It just says each researcher works in one of two labs. So, it's possible that each lab has multiple researchers, but the problem doesn't specify the total number. So, maybe I can't assume that each lab has exactly two people. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says each researcher works in one of two labs, and each has a favorite beverage. So, the only info is about their lab assignments and beverage preferences. There's no info on how many people are in each lab.\n\nSo, maybe I can't assume that the labs have the same number of people. So, perhaps I need to look for any universal rules or constraints.\n\nWait, the problem says \"four researchers,\" so there are four people: Priya, Qadir, Ravi, Sita. Each works in either Lab-North or Lab-South, and each has a favorite beverage (coffee or tea). So, each of the four has a lab assignment and a beverage.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\nFrom point 1: Priya is in Lab-North.\n\nFrom point 2: Qadir is in Lab-South.\n\nFrom point 4: Sita is in Lab-North.\n\nSo, that's three people assigned to labs: Priya and Sita in Lab-North, Qadir in Lab-South. So, only Ravi's lab is unknown.\n\nWait, so if there are four researchers, and three are already assigned to the labs, then Ravi must be in the remaining lab. But wait, are the labs each having a specific number of people, or can they have any number?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, so I think Ravi could be in either lab. But maybe there's more info.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of people in each lab is determined by the number of researchers in each. So, if three are in Lab-North (Priya, Sita, and possibly Ravi), and one in Lab-South (Qadir). Or, if two in each lab, but that would require Ravi to be in Lab-South, but then Lab-South would have two people: Qadir and Ravi. But the problem doesn't specify the number of people per lab, so I can't assume that.\n\nWait, but maybe I can figure it out based on the beverages. Let me think.\n\nWe know that Priya drinks tea, Ravi drinks coffee, and Sita and Qadir's beverages are unknown.\n\nIs there any rule that links lab assignments and beverage preferences? Not directly given, but maybe through some indirect reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the labs have a certain beverage preference. For example, maybe Lab-North prefers coffee and Lab-South prefers tea, or something like that. But the problem doesn't state that, so I can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of people in each lab is determined by the number of beverage preferences. But that seems like a stretch.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each lab can have multiple people, but each person's lab assignment is independent, unless there's a rule that links them.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any such rule. So, maybe I can't link the beverage preferences to the lab assignments.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think about the problem again. It says four researchers, each in one of two labs, each has a favorite beverage. The given info is:\n\n1. Priya: Lab-North.\n\n2. Qadir: Lab-South.\n\n3. Ravi: Coffee.\n\n4. Sita: Lab-North.\n\n5. Priya: Tea.\n\nSo, from this, we can see that:\n\n- Lab-North has Priya and Sita.\n\n- Lab-South has Qadir.\n\n- Ravi is the only one left, so Ravi must be in either Lab-North or Lab-South.\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically about Ravi's lab.\n\nIs there any way to figure out Ravi's lab based on the given info?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of people in each lab is equal? But with four researchers, that would mean two in each lab. So, if three are already in Lab-North (Priya, Sita, and Ravi), then Lab-South would have only Qadir, which is one person. But the problem doesn't specify that the labs have the same number of people, so that might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labs have a certain capacity, but again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the beverages. Since Priya drinks tea and Ravi drinks coffee, maybe there's a correlation between lab and beverage. For example, maybe Lab-North has more tea drinkers or coffee drinkers, but without any information, I can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labs have a specific beverage, but again, the problem doesn't state that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it this way: If I assume that each lab has exactly two people, then since three people are already in Lab-North (Priya, Sita, and Ravi), that would exceed two. So, that can't be. Therefore, maybe each lab can have more than two people, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that each lab has a certain number of people, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps Ravi can be in either lab.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for Ravi's lab, so perhaps there's more to it.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the number of people in each lab based on the given info.\n\nWe have four researchers: Priya, Qadir, Ravi, Sita.\n\nAssignments:\n\n- Priya: Lab-North.\n\n- Qadir: Lab-South.\n\n- Sita: Lab-North.\n\nSo, that's three people assigned. So, Ravi must be the fourth, and can be in either lab.\n\nBut the problem is asking for Ravi's lab, so maybe I can find a way to determine it.\n\nWait, maybe the number of people in each lab is equal, but with four researchers, that would mean two in each lab. So, if three are already in Lab-North, that can't be. Therefore, maybe the labs don't have to be equal in size.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labs have a certain number of people, but the problem doesn't specify, so I can't assume that.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each lab has at least one person, but that's obvious since Qadir is in Lab-South and Priya and Sita are in Lab-North.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the beverages again. If I assume that each lab has a certain number of people, but I don't know.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each researcher works in one of two labs, and each has a favorite beverage, maybe the labs have a certain number of people, but without more info, I can't determine that.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is that the problem is solvable, so there must be a way to determine Ravi's lab based on the given info.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about the fact that Priya and Sita are both in Lab-North, and both have beverage preferences. Priya drinks tea, Sita's beverage is unknown, Ravi drinks coffee",
