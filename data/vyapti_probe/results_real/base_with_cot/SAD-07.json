  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this theorem-proving system that's trying to prove that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. Let me go through the proof step by step to see if it's valid.\n\nFirst, the proof starts by letting p be a prime number greater than 2. That makes sense because we're focusing on primes beyond 2, which is the only even prime.\n\nNext, it assumes that p is even. So, p equals 2k for some integer k greater than 1. That seems okay because if p is even, it can be expressed as 2 times another number. \n\nThen, it states that since p is 2k, p is divisible by 2. That's correct because any number multiplied by 2 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n\nNow, the proof says that since p is greater than 2 and divisible by 2, p is not prime because it has a factor other than 1 and itself. Wait, here I need to think carefully. If p is divisible by 2, and p is greater than 2, then yes, p must have 2 as a factor besides 1 and itself. So, p can't be prime. That makes sense because primes have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. If p is divisible by 2 and p > 2, then 2 is another divisor, making it not prime.\n\nThe next step is the contradiction. The proof assumes p is even (so p = 2k) and then concludes that p is not prime, which contradicts the premise that p is prime. Therefore, the assumption that p is even must be false, so p is not even and thus must be odd.\n\nHmm, that seems logical. But wait, let me think about whether there are any exceptions or if any universal rules might not hold here. The proof uses the definition of prime numbers: a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, if a number is divisible by 2 and it's greater than 2, it can't be prime because it has at least three divisors: 1, 2, and itself.\n\nIs there any case where this reasoning might fail? Well, let's consider the number 2 itself. The proof is about primes greater than 2, so 2 isn't included. But 2 is even and prime, so the proof correctly excludes it. For any even number greater than 2, it's composite, so the proof holds.\n\nI don't see any universal rules that would be violated here. The proof uses basic properties of numbers, divisibility, and the definition of primes. It's a straightforward proof by contradiction, which is a valid method in mathematics.\n\nWait, another thought: does the proof cover all possible cases? It starts by assuming p is even and shows that leads to a contradiction, so p must be odd. Since the only even prime is 2, and we're considering primes greater than 2, all such primes must be odd. That seems to cover all cases.\n\nIs there any possible prime number greater than 2 that is even? No, because any even number greater than 2 is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. So, the proof is solid.\n\nI think the proof is valid because it correctly uses the definition of primes and the properties of even numbers to show that no even number greater than 2 can be prime. The contradiction arises naturally from the assumption, leading to the conclusion that primes greater than 2 must be odd.\n</think>\n\nThe proof is valid. It correctly uses the definition of prime numbers and the properties of even numbers to demonstrate that all prime numbers greater than 2 must be odd. The reasoning is logical and covers all necessary cases without exception.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assumption:** Let \\( p \\) be a prime number greater than 2.\n\n2. **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume \\( p \\) is even.\n\n3. **Express \\( p \\) as Even:** If \\( p \\) is even, then \\( p = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\).\n\n4. **Divisibility by 2:** Since \\( p = 2k \\), \\( p \\) is divisible by 2.\n\n5. **Implications of Divisibility:** Because \\( p > 2 \\) and \\( p \\) is divisible by 2, \\( p \\) has at least three divisors: 1, 2, and itself. Hence, \\( p \\) is not prime.\n\n6. **Contradiction:** This conclusion that \\( p \\) is not prime contradicts the initial premise that \\( p \\) is prime.\n\n7. **Conclusion from Contradiction:** Since assuming \\( p \\) is even leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false.\n\n8. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, \\( p \\) cannot be even and must be odd.\n\nThis proof effectively demonstrates that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd by contradiction, confirming the validity of the theorem.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, the proof is valid.",
