  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are two variables, X and Y. The problem says that X is true if and only if Y is true. And also, Y is true. I need to figure out what the value of X is. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall what \"if and only if\" means in logic. I think it's a biconditional statement, which means both directions are true. So, X being true implies Y is true, and Y being true implies X is true. So, X \u2194 Y. That means X and Y have the same truth value. They're either both true or both false.\n\nNow, the second part says Y is true. So, Y is true. Since X and Y are equivalent, whatever Y is, X must be the same. If Y is true, then X must also be true. There's no exception here because the statement is a biconditional, so it's not like X could be true when Y is false or vice versa.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that Y could be something else? No, the problem directly states that Y is true. So, Y is definitely true. Therefore, since X is true if and only if Y is true, X must also be true.\n\nI don't think there's a counterexample here because the statements are straightforward. The biconditional ensures that X and Y are directly tied in their truth values. So, if Y is true, X has to be true as well. There's no scenario where Y is true and X isn't, given the definition provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since Y is true and X is true exactly when Y is true, X must be true.\n</think>\n\nThe value of X is true.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Definitions:**\n   - The statement \"X is true if and only if Y is true\" is a biconditional (X \u2194 Y). This means both X and Y have the same truth value.\n   - Additionally, it's given that Y is true (Y is true).\n\n2. **Apply the Biconditional Relationship:**\n   - Since X \u2194 Y, whenever Y is true, X must also be true, and vice versa.\n   - Given Y is true, substituting into the biconditional, X must be true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, X is true.\n\n**Answer:** X is true.",
