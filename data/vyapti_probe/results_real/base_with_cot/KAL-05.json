  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Building Z complies with the current building code. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original building code from 2015 says that all residential buildings must have a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. That's straightforward. So any building built before 2022 would have to meet this 8-foot standard.\n\nThen, in 2022, there was an amendment. The new rule states that all residential buildings constructed after 2020 must have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet. But for buildings that were constructed before 2020, they are \"grandfathered\" under the original code. That means those older buildings don't have to meet the higher 9-foot standard; they can still stick with the 8-foot ceiling as per the original code.\n\nNow, Building Z was constructed in 2023. That's after 2020, so according to the amendment, it should have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet. But the building has 8.5-foot ceilings. Hmm, that's lower than the required 9 feet. So at first glance, it seems like Building Z doesn't comply because it's below the current standard.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The amendment mentions that buildings constructed before 2020 are grandfathered. But Building Z was built in 2023, which is after 2020. So it doesn't fall under the grandfather clause. Therefore, it must meet the higher 9-foot requirement.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this? Maybe I should consider if the grandfathering applies to buildings that were already built before 2020, but not to those built after. So any building built after 2020, regardless of when the code changed, must meet the new standard.\n\nSo, since Building Z was built in 2023, it's subject to the 2022 amendment. Therefore, it needs to have at least 9-foot ceilings. Having 8.5 feet is below that, so it doesn't comply.\n\nI don't see any exceptions or counterexamples here. The key is that the amendment specifically mentions that only buildings built before 2020 are grandfathered. So newer buildings like Building Z must meet the updated requirement.\n</think>\n\nBuilding Z does not comply with the current building code. It was constructed in 2023, after 2020, and thus must meet the 9-foot ceiling requirement. However, it only has 8.5-foot ceilings, which are below the required standard. Therefore, it does not comply.\n\n**Answer:** Building Z does not comply with the current building code.",
