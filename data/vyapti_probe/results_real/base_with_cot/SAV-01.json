  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where six employees work in two departments: Engineering and Marketing. Their names are Aarav, Bina, Chetan, Diya, Esha, and Farid. Each of them has a department and a work location. Now, Gita is a new hire assigned to Engineering, and I need to figure out if she must work remotely based on the given information.\n\nLet me list out the details again to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Aarav is in Engineering and works remotely.\n2. Bina is in Engineering and works remotely.\n3. Chetan is in Engineering and works on-site.\n4. Diya is in Marketing and works remotely.\n5. Esha is in Engineering and works remotely.\n6. Farid is in Engineering and works remotely.\n\nSo, all the employees except Chetan are in Engineering and work remotely. Chetan is the only one in Engineering who works on-site. Diya is the only one in Marketing and works remotely.\n\nNow, Gita is a new hire assigned to Engineering. The question is whether she must work remotely.\n\nFirst, I need to think about any universal rules or patterns in the given information. It seems like in the Engineering department, most people work remotely except for Chetan. In Marketing, only Diya is there, and she works remotely.\n\nIs there a rule that if someone is in Engineering, they must work on-site? Well, no. Because Aarav, Bina, Esha, and Farid all work remotely. So, the presence in Engineering doesn't automatically mean on-site work. It's possible to work remotely.\n\nSimilarly, in Marketing, Diya works remotely. So, if someone is in Marketing, they might work remotely as well.\n\nBut wait, Chetan is the only one in Engineering who works on-site. So, is it possible that only certain people in Engineering work on-site, and others work remotely? It seems like that's the case.\n\nSo, Gita is being assigned to Engineering. The question is whether she must work remotely. Based on the given information, there's no rule that says all Engineering employees must work on-site. In fact, most of them work remotely, except Chetan.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific rule that says Engineering employees must work on-site, Gita could work remotely. But wait, is there any information that might suggest that all Engineering employees must work on-site? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n- Aarav: Engineering, remote\n- Bina: Engineering, remote\n- Chetan: Engineering, on-site\n- Diya: Marketing, remote\n- Esha: Engineering, remote\n- Farid: Engineering, remote\n\nSo, all Engineering employees except Chetan work remotely. Chetan is the only one who works on-site. So, if Gita is assigned to Engineering, she could either work on-site or remotely. There's no information that says all Engineering employees must work on-site, only that Chetan does.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a company policy that requires all Engineering employees to work on-site, which isn't stated here, Gita could work remotely. But the question is whether she \"must\" work remotely. So, must she? Or is it possible that she could work on-site?\n\nWait, the problem says \"must Gita work remotely?\" So, based on the given information, is there any reason why she must work remotely?\n\nLooking at the information, the only thing we know is that in Engineering, most people work remotely except Chetan. So, if Gita is assigned to Engineering, she could be in the same category as Aarav, Bina, Esha, and Farid, who all work remotely. But Chetan is the only one who works on-site. So, is there any rule that says only Chetan can work on-site in Engineering, or can others do so as well?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any such rule. It only tells us about the current employees. So, unless there's a rule that all Engineering employees must work on-site, which isn't stated, Gita could work either on-site or remotely.\n\nBut the question is whether she \"must\" work remotely. So, is there any information that would require her to work remotely?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that all the other Engineering employees work remotely implies that it's the norm, so Gita must follow suit. But that's an assumption, not a fact. The problem doesn't state any policies or rules about work locations, only the current work locations of the existing employees.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the given information, there's no rule that says Gita must work on-site or remotely. She could choose either. But the question is whether she \"must\" work remotely.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"must Gita work remotely?\" So, is there any reason she must? Or is it possible that she could work on-site?\n\nGiven that Chetan is the only one in Engineering who works on-site, maybe the company allows some on-site work in Engineering, but it's not required. So, Gita could work on-site if she wants, but she's not required to. So, she doesn't have to work remotely.\n\nBut the question is whether she \"must\" work remotely. So, does she have to? Or can she choose?\n\nI think the key here is that the problem doesn't provide any information that would require her to work on-site or remotely. It only tells us about the current employees' work locations. So, unless there's a rule that all Engineering employees must work on-site, which isn't stated, she can work either way.\n\nBut the question is whether she \"must\" work remotely. So, the answer would be no, she doesn't have to work remotely. She could work on-site or remotely.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"must Gita work remotely?\" So, is the answer that she doesn't have to, or that she must?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking whether she must work remotely based solely on the given information. So, is there any rule or pattern that would require her to work remotely?\n\nLooking at the departments: Engineering and Marketing. In Engineering, most people work remotely except Chetan. In Marketing, only Diya works remotely. So, if someone is in Marketing, they work remotely. But Gita is in Engineering.\n\nSo, in Marketing, all employees (only Diya) work remotely. In Engineering, all except Chetan work remotely. So, is there a rule that if you're in Marketing, you must work remotely, or if you're in Engineering, you must work on-site?\n\nWait, no. Because in Engineering, most work remotely, except Chetan. So, the department doesn't dictate the work location necessarily. It's possible to work remotely in Engineering or on-site.\n\nSimilarly, in Marketing, Diya works remotely. But if someone else was in Marketing, could they work on-site? The problem doesn't say. It only tells us about Diya.\n\nSo, unless there's a rule that all Marketing employees must work remotely, which isn't stated, Gita's department is Engineering, where most work remotely except one.\n\nTherefore, Gita could work remotely or on-site. But the question is whether she must work remotely. So, must she? Or is it possible that she could work on-site?\n\nSince the problem doesn't provide any information that would require her to work on-site or remotely, the answer is that she doesn't have to work remotely. She could work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking whether she \"must\" work remotely. So, the answer is no, she doesn't have to. Therefore, she can work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"must Gita work remotely?\" So, the answer is no, she doesn't have to. Therefore, she can work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut the question is whether she must, so the answer is no, she doesn't have to. So, she can work on-site.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking whether she must work remotely. So, the answer is no, she doesn't have to. Therefore, she can work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut the problem is asking whether she must work remotely, so the answer is no, she doesn't have to. Therefore, she can work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut the question is whether she must work remotely. So, the answer is no, she doesn't have to. Therefore, she can work on-site or remotely.\n\nBut the problem is asking whether she must work remotely. So, the answer is no, she doesn't have to.
