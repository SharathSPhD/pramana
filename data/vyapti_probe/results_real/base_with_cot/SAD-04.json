  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if User Y is authorized based on the given access control rule. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the rule says: \"User X is authorized if and only if User X appears in the authorized users list.\" That means authorization is directly tied to being on that list. There's no ambiguity here\u2014it's a straightforward condition.\n\nNext, it mentions that the authorized users list contains exactly those users who are authorized. So, the list is both a necessary and sufficient condition for authorization. If someone is on the list, they're authorized, and if they're authorized, they must be on the list.\n\nNow, User Y is requesting access. The question is whether User Y is authorized. According to the rule, the only way to be authorized is to be on the list. There's no mention of any exceptions or alternative methods for authorization. The rule doesn't say something like \"if you're in the list OR you have a manager who says so,\" which would complicate things.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that User Y is authorized without being on the list. The rule is an \"if and only if,\" which means both directions are true. So, if User Y is authorized, they must be on the list, and if they're on the list, they're authorized. There's no alternative pathway for authorization here.\n\nWait, could there be a scenario where User Y is added to the list after the request? Well, the rule doesn't specify that the list is static. It just defines the condition for authorization. So, if the administrator adds User Y to the list, then yes, they become authorized. But the question is about whether User Y is authorized now, not whether they will be after some action.\n\nSo, unless User Y is already on the list, they aren't authorized. The rule doesn't provide any other criteria for authorization. It's all about the list.\n\nI don't see any exceptions or alternative conditions. The rule is pretty clear and direct. Therefore, unless User Y is explicitly added to the authorized users list by the administrator, they don't meet the condition for authorization.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases. The rule is straightforward, so unless there's a change to the list, User Y isn't authorized.\n</think>\n\nUser Y is not authorized because the access control rule explicitly states that authorization is dependent solely on appearing in the authorized users list. Since User Y is not on the list, they do not meet the criteria for authorization.\n\n**Answer:** No, User Y is not authorized.",
