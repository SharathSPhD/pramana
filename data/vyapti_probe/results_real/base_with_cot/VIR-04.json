  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this policy statement: \"No employee who has not completed the safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\" I need to figure out if Employee Z, who has completed the safety training, is allowed into the restricted zone.\n\nFirst, let me try to translate this into a logical statement. The original statement is a conditional, right? It's saying that if an employee hasn't completed the safety training, then they can't enter the restricted zone. So in logical terms, I can write this as: If not (safety training completed), then not permitted in restricted zone.\n\nUsing some symbols, let me denote:\n- Let E represent \"an employee.\"\n- Let C represent \"has completed the safety training.\"\n- Let P represent \"is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\"\n\nSo the statement becomes: If not C, then not P. In logical notation, that's \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNow, the question is about Employee Z. It says that Employee Z has completed the safety training. So for Employee Z, C is true. So we have C(Z) is true.\n\nWe need to find out if P(Z) is true, meaning whether Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\nFrom the logical statement \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP, if we know that \u00acC is false (because C is true for Z), then the implication holds. In logic, an implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So in this case, since \u00acC is false, the implication \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of \u00acP.\n\nWait, so if an employee has completed the safety training, the statement doesn't say anything about their permission. It only restricts those who haven't completed the training. So the policy is permissive for those who have completed the training; they are allowed in, but it doesn't explicitly say they are permitted. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, actually, the original statement is a universal rule. It says no one without training is permitted. So for those who have training, the rule doesn't explicitly say they are permitted, but implicitly, since it's only restricting the untrained, it's allowing the trained. So in logic, if the only restriction is on \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP, then the converse, C \u2192 P, isn't necessarily stated, but in this case, the policy is about permissions, so it's likely that completing the training allows you in.\n\nBut wait, logically, the statement is only saying that not completing the training means you can't enter. It doesn't say that completing the training means you can. So maybe there are other restrictions? Or maybe the policy is only about that one condition.\n\nWait, but in real-life policies, usually, if you meet the condition (complete training), you are allowed. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that if you have completed the training, you are permitted. So the contrapositive of \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP is P \u2192 C. So if you are permitted, then you must have completed the training. But the original statement is about the converse: if you haven't completed, you aren't permitted. So the original statement doesn't directly say that completing allows you in, but it does imply that if you have completed, you can't be restricted by this rule.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The contrapositive of \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP is C \u2192 P. So if you have completed the training, then you are permitted. So the contrapositive is logically equivalent, so we can infer that.\n\nSo, in other words, the original statement is equivalent to saying that if you have completed the training, you are permitted. Therefore, since Employee Z has completed the training, they are permitted.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it in terms of sets: The restricted zone is only accessible to those who have completed the training. So if you have completed the training, you can go in; if not, you can't. So Employee Z, having completed the training, can enter.\n\nI think that makes sense. So the answer is yes, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n</think>\n\nYes, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Policy Statement:**\n   - The policy says, \"No employee who has not completed safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\"\n   - This can be logically represented as: If an employee has NOT completed safety training (\u00acC), then they are NOT permitted to enter (\u00acP). Symbolically, \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP.\n\n2. **Identify the Logical Implication:**\n   - The contrapositive of \u00acC \u2192 \u00acP is C \u2192 P. This means if an employee has completed the safety training (C), then they are permitted to enter (P).\n\n3. **Apply the Policy to Employee Z:**\n   - Employee Z has completed the safety training (C(Z) is true).\n   - According to the contrapositive (C \u2192 P), since C(Z) is true, P(Z) must also be true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.",
