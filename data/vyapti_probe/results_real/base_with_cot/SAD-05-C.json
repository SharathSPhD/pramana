  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this recursive formula here, and I need to figure out what f(4) is. Let me start by writing down the problem again to make sure I have it right.\n\nThe formula is defined as:\n- f(1) = 1\n- f(n) = f(n-1) + n for n > 1\n\nAlright, so f(1) is given as 1. For any n greater than 1, the function f(n) is equal to f(n-1) plus n. That seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand how this works step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute f(2) first. Since n=2 is greater than 1, I can use the recursive formula. So f(2) = f(2-1) + 2. That simplifies to f(1) + 2. We know f(1) is 1, so f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to f(3). Using the same recursive formula, f(3) = f(3-1) + 3. That becomes f(2) + 3. We just found out that f(2) is 3, so f(3) = 3 + 3 = 6. Got it.\n\nNext, I need to find f(4). Using the formula again, f(4) = f(4-1) + 4. So that's f(3) + 4. From the previous step, f(3) is 6, so f(4) = 6 + 4 = 10. Hmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that this pattern holds and that there aren't any exceptions or mistakes in my reasoning. Let me write down the values I have so far:\n\n- f(1) = 1\n- f(2) = 3\n- f(3) = 6\n- f(4) = 10\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is increasing by an additional number. From f(1) to f(2), we add 2. From f(2) to f(3), we add 3. From f(3) to f(4), we add 4. So each time, the increment is equal to the current n value.\n\nThis reminds me of the triangular numbers, which are formed by summing up the natural numbers up to a certain point. The formula for the nth triangular number is n(n + 1)/2. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nFor n=1: 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1, which matches f(1).\nFor n=2: 2(2 + 1)/2 = 3, which matches f(2).\nFor n=3: 3(3 + 1)/2 = 6, which matches f(3).\nFor n=4: 4(4 + 1)/2 = 10, which matches f(4).\n\nSo it seems like f(n) is indeed the nth triangular number. That makes sense because each term is the sum of all previous terms plus the current term. So, f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, which is the definition of triangular numbers.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute f(5) using the recursive formula and see if it follows the triangular number pattern. f(5) = f(4) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. Using the triangular number formula: 5(5 + 1)/2 = 15. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, since the formula for f(n) is the sum from 1 to n, f(4) should be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. That's consistent with both the recursive computation and the triangular number formula.\n\nI don't see any exceptions or issues here. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the pattern holds consistently. Therefore, I can confidently say that f(4) is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(4) \\) is \\boxed{10}.\n</think>\n\nThe problem defines a recursive formula:\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + n \\) for \\( n > 1 \\)\n\nTo find \\( f(4) \\), we compute the values step by step:\n- \\( f(2) = f(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n- \\( f(3) = f(2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( f(4) = f(3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \\)\n\nWe recognize that \\( f(n) \\) corresponds to the nth triangular number, which is given by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). Verifying this:\n- For \\( n = 4 \\), the triangular number is \\( \\frac{4(4 + 1)}{2} = 10 \\).\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(4) \\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
