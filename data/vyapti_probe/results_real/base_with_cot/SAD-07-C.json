  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational is valid. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the proof starts by assuming the opposite of what it's trying to prove. That makes sense because it's a proof by contradiction. So, assuming \u221a2 is rational. Got it.\n\nStep 1: \u221a2 = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors. That's the definition of a rational number, right? If a number can be expressed as a fraction of two integers with no common factors, it's rational. So, this seems okay.\n\nStep 2: Squaring both sides gives 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2. Then multiplying both sides by q\u00b2, we get p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2. That seems straightforward. No issues here.\n\nStep 3: Since p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, that means p\u00b2 is even because it's two times something. So, p must be even. Wait, is that necessarily true? If a square is even, does that mean the number itself is even? Let me think. Yes, because if p were odd, then p\u00b2 would be odd (since an odd number times itself is odd). So, if p\u00b2 is even, p must be even. So, step 3 is correct.\n\nStep 4: Let p = 2k, where k is an integer. Then, substituting back into p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, we get (2k)\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, which is 4k\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 2k\u00b2 = q\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 is equal to 2k\u00b2. That makes sense.\n\nStep 5: Now, since q\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2, that means q\u00b2 is even. Therefore, q must be even as well. Wait, similar to step 3, if q\u00b2 is even, q has to be even. Because if q were odd, q\u00b2 would be odd. So, yes, step 5 is correct.\n\nStep 6: Here's where it gets tricky. The proof says that if both p and q are even, they share a common factor of 2. That would contradict the initial assumption that p and q have no common factors. So, this is the contradiction that shows \u221a2 can't be rational. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, is there any possibility that p and q could be even but still have no common factors? Hmm, if both p and q are even, then they both are divisible by 2, so their greatest common divisor is at least 2. That contradicts the initial assumption that p and q have no common factors. So, that's a valid contradiction.\n\nLet me think if there's any other way this could go wrong. Maybe if p or q is zero? But \u221a2 is not zero, so p and q can't be zero. Also, if q is zero, that would make \u221a2 undefined, which isn't the case here. So, p and q must be non-zero integers.\n\nAnother thing to consider: could p and q have other common factors besides 2? Well, if p and q both are even, they have at least 2 as a common factor, which already violates the initial condition. So, no, that's not a concern.\n\nWait, but what if k and q share a common factor? Let me see. From step 4, we have q\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 is twice a square, which suggests that q must be even, as we saw. So, q is even, and p is also even, so they must share a factor of 2. Therefore, the contradiction holds.\n\nIs there a different angle to look at this? Maybe considering prime factors. If \u221a2 were rational, then it would have a prime factorization with integer exponents. But \u221a2 is irrational, so that can't be. However, the proof given doesn't use prime factors, so maybe that's a different approach, but the given proof is still valid.\n\nWait, could there be a case where p and q are both even but somehow don't have a common factor? No, because if both are even, they must share at least the factor 2. So, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the proof seems solid. Each step logically follows from the previous one, and the contradiction is unavoidable. So, the original proof is valid.\n</think>\n\nThe proof is valid. Each step logically follows from the previous one, and the contradiction demonstrates that \u221a2 cannot be rational. Therefore, \u221a2 is irrational.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assumption:** Assume \u221a2 is rational. Then, it can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms).\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:** Squaring both sides of \u221a2 = p/q gives 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2.\n\n3. **Isolate p\u00b2:** Multiply both sides by q\u00b2 to obtain p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2.\n\n4. **Evenness of p\u00b2:** Since p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, p\u00b2 is even. Therefore, p must be even (because the square of an odd number is odd).\n\n5. **Express p as 2k:** Let p = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\n6. **Substitute p into the Equation:** Substitute p = 2k into p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2 to get (2k)\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, which simplifies to 4k\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2.\n\n7. **Simplify the Equation:** Divide both sides by 2 to obtain 2k\u00b2 = q\u00b2.\n\n8. **Evenness of q\u00b2:** Since q\u00b2 = 2k\u00b2, q\u00b2 is even. Therefore, q must be even.\n\n9. **Contradiction:** Both p and q are even, which means they share a common factor of 2. This contradicts the initial assumption that p and q have no common factors.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** Since the assumption that \u221a2 is rational leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, \u221a2 is irrational.\n\n**Final Answer:** The proof is valid and correctly demonstrates that \u221a2 is irrational.",
