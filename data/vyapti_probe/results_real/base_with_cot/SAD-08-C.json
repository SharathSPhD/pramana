  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to assign three tasks, T1, T2, and T3, to three different time slots: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. The constraints are that T1 must be scheduled before T2, and T2 must be scheduled before T3. Hmm, I need to figure out a valid schedule that satisfies both of these constraints.\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem better. There are three tasks and three time slots, so each task must go into a different slot. The constraints are about the order of the tasks: T1 before T2, and T2 before T3. So, essentially, T1 must come before T2, and T2 must come before T3. That means the order of the tasks should be T1, then T2, then T3, but not necessarily all in a straight sequence because they can be spread out across different time slots.\n\nWait, but the time slots are Morning, Afternoon, and Evening, which are in a specific order. So, Morning comes first, then Afternoon, then Evening. So, if I assign a task to Morning, it's earlier than any task assigned to Afternoon or Evening. Similarly, Afternoon tasks are earlier than Evening tasks.\n\nSo, maybe I can think of this as assigning the tasks to time slots in such a way that their order is preserved. That is, T1 must be in an earlier time slot than T2, and T2 must be in an earlier time slot than T3. But since the time slots themselves have a fixed order, I need to make sure that the tasks are assigned in a way that their order is respected.\n\nLet me consider the possible permutations of the time slots. Since each task must be assigned to a different slot, the number of possible permutations is 3! = 6. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Morning, Afternoon, Evening\n2. Morning, Evening, Afternoon\n3. Afternoon, Morning, Evening\n4. Afternoon, Evening, Morning\n5. Evening, Morning, Afternoon\n6. Evening, Afternoon, Morning\n\nNow, I need to assign T1, T2, T3 to these slots such that T1 is before T2 and T2 is before T3. Let's see which of these permutations can satisfy this.\n\nLooking at permutation 1: Morning, Afternoon, Evening. If I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Afternoon, and T3 to Evening, that would satisfy T1 before T2 and T2 before T3. So that's a valid schedule.\n\nPermutation 2: Morning, Evening, Afternoon. If I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Evening, and T3 to Afternoon. Wait, but T2 is Evening and T3 is Afternoon. But Evening comes after Afternoon, so T3 is Afternoon, which is before Evening. That would mean T2 is after T3, which violates the constraint that T2 must be before T3. So this permutation isn't valid.\n\nPermutation 3: Afternoon, Morning, Evening. Assigning T1 to Afternoon, T2 to Morning, and T3 to Evening. But T2 is Morning, which is before Afternoon where T1 is. That violates the constraint that T1 must be before T2. So this is invalid.\n\nPermutation 4: Afternoon, Evening, Morning. Assigning T1 to Afternoon, T2 to Evening, T3 to Morning. Again, T3 is Morning, which is before Afternoon, so T1 is after T3. Also, T2 is Evening, which is after Afternoon, so T2 is after T1. So T1 is after T2, which violates the T1 before T2 constraint. So invalid.\n\nPermutation 5: Evening, Morning, Afternoon. Assigning T1 to Evening, T2 to Morning, T3 to Afternoon. T2 is Morning, which is before Evening, so T1 is after T2. That's bad. Also, T3 is Afternoon, which is after Morning, so T2 is before T3. But since T1 is after T2, this is invalid.\n\nPermutation 6: Evening, Afternoon, Morning. Assigning T1 to Evening, T2 to Afternoon, T3 to Morning. T2 is Afternoon, which is before Evening, so T1 is after T2. That's bad. Also, T3 is Morning, which is before Afternoon, so T2 is after T3. So both constraints are violated.\n\nSo, out of all the permutations, only permutation 1: Morning, Afternoon, Evening works when assigning T1, T2, T3 respectively. But wait, is that the only one? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assign the tasks differently within the same permutation. For example, in permutation 1, if I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Afternoon, T3 to Evening, that works. But what if I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Evening, and T3 to Afternoon? Wait, that's permutation 2, which we saw earlier is invalid because T3 would be Afternoon, which is before Evening. So that's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, in permutation 3, if I try to assign T1 to Afternoon, T2 to Morning, T3 to Evening, that's invalid because T1 is after T2.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it differently. Since the time slots have a fixed order, the earliest slot is Morning, then Afternoon, then Evening. So, to satisfy T1 before T2 and T2 before T3, T1 must be in an earlier slot than T2, and T2 must be in an earlier slot than T3.\n\nSo, T1 must be in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening. That's the only way to ensure that T1 is before T2 and T2 is before T3.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way? For example, if T1 is in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening. That's one way. But what if T1 is in Morning, T2 in Evening, and T3 in Afternoon? Wait, that would mean T2 is Evening, which is after T3 in Afternoon, so that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if T1 is in Afternoon, T2 in Evening, T3 in Morning. That's also invalid because T1 is after T2.\n\nWait, so the only way to have T1 before T2 and T2 before T3 is to have T1 in the earliest possible slot, T2 in the next, and T3 in the latest.\n\nTherefore, the only valid schedule is:\n\n- T1 in Morning\n- T2 in Afternoon\n- T3 in Evening\n\nI don't think there's any other way to assign them without violating the constraints. Let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Afternoon, and T3 to Evening. That works. What if I assign T1 to Morning, T2 to Evening, and T3 to Afternoon? As I thought earlier, that's invalid because T3 is Afternoon, which is before Evening. So T2 would be after T3, which is not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to assign T1 to Afternoon, T2 to Evening, T3 to Morning, that's invalid because T1 is after T2 and T3 is before T2.\n\nTherefore, the only valid schedule is T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, T3 in Evening.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n- T1: Morning\n- T2: Afternoon\n- T3: Evening\n</think>\n\nTo satisfy the constraints that T1 must be scheduled before T2 and T2 before T3, the only valid schedule is:\n\n- T1 in the Morning slot,\n- T2 in the Afternoon slot, and\n- T3 in the Evening slot.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n- T1 is scheduled in the Morning.\n- T2 is scheduled in the Afternoon.\n- T3 is scheduled in the Evening.",
