Let me go through the problem step by step using the Nyaya methodology. \n\nFirst, the problem states that on Jan 1, User A was granted access to Server X. Then, on Mar 15, their access was revoked. Now, on Jun 1, User A tries to access the server. The question is whether access should be granted.\n\nStarting with Samshaya, which is the doubt analysis. I'm a bit confused about the timeline here. The access was granted and then revoked, so does that mean it's no longer active? Or is there a possibility it can be reinstated? I think the key point is understanding the nature of the access grant and revocation.\n\nNext, Pramana, sources of knowledge. The information comes from the log entries. The logs show the grant and revocation, so those are the primary sources. There's no conflicting information from other sources, so I can rely on these logs.\n\nMoving on to Pancha Avayava, the five-member syllogism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think it involves premises and a conclusion. The first premise is that access was granted on Jan 1. The second premise is that it was revoked on Mar 15. The conclusion would be that access is now denied. But wait, is the revocation a permanent denial or just a temporary one? In some systems, revocation might mean access is removed, but maybe it can be reinstated under certain conditions. So, I need to consider if the revocation was absolute or conditional.\n\nTarka is counterfactual reasoning. Let me think: If User A's access was granted and then revoked, what if the revocation wasn't properly documented or if there's a way to appeal it? If the system allows for appeals or reinstatements, then maybe access can be granted again. But if the revocation was final, then no.\n\nHetvabhasa is fallacy check. I need to make sure I'm not falling into any logical errors. Am I assuming something without evidence? For example, assuming that revocation means permanent denial without checking the system's policies. I should verify if revocation typically means access is permanently stripped or if it can be reinstated after a period.\n\nFinally, Nirnaya, ascertainment. After considering all the above, I need to make a definitive conclusion. If the revocation was absolute, then access should be denied. If it's conditional and can be reinstated, then maybe it should be granted again. But without more information, I think the default is that revocation means access is removed unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the access was granted and then revoked. Unless there's a reason to reinstate it, the system should deny access on June 1.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nNo, the system should not grant User A access to Server X on June 1. The access was revoked on Mar 15, and without any indication of reinstatement, the revocation implies that access is no longer granted.",
