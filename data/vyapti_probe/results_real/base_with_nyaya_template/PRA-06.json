The steps are followed systematically to determine if Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus. The conclusion is that Rishi does live within 5 km based on the given premises and logical reasoning.\n\nThe code provided outlines each step of the Nyaya process, including the identification of doubt, sources of knowledge, construction of a syllogism, counterfactual reasoning, fallacy checking, and final ascertainment. The conclusion is reached by logically deducing that since all bicycle owners live within 5 km and Rishi owns a bicycle, Rishi must live within that distance.\n```\n\nThe final answer is **Yes**.\n```",
