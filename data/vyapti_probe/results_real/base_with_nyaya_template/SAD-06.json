The major premise states that all Type-X objects have Feature-P, the minor premise states that Object Q has Feature-P, and the conclusion correctly follows that Object Q is Type-X. Additionally, the counterfactual reasoning confirms that without Feature-P, Object Q wouldn't be classified as Type-X, supporting the validity of the classification.\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nThe classification is logically valid. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{Valid}.\n```\n\nThe classification is logically valid because the syllogism formed by the premises and the conclusion is valid.
