Each friend can order pasta, sushi, or salad, but each must choose a different dish. So, the initial possibilities are:\n   - Jun: pasta, sushi, salad\n   - Kira: pasta, sushi, salad\n   - Lev: pasta, sushi, salad\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**  \n   We look at the given information:\n   - Jun does not order pasta. (Source: Problem statement)\n   - Kira orders sushi. (Source: Problem statement)\n   - Lev does not order salad. (Source: Problem statement)\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**  \n   We construct a syllogism with five premises:\n   - Premise 1: Jun does not order pasta.\n   - Premise 2: Kira orders sushi.\n   - Premise 3: Lev does not order salad.\n   - Premise 4: Each person orders a different dish.\n   - Premise 5: There are three dishes and three people.\n\n   From this, we can infer that:\n   - Since Kira orders sushi, neither Jun nor Lev can order sushi.\n   - Jun cannot order pasta, so he must order salad or sushi. But sushi is taken, so Jun must order salad.\n   - Lev cannot order salad, so he must order pasta or sushi. Since sushi is taken, Lev must order pasta.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**  \n   We consider counterfactuals to ensure our conclusions hold:\n   - If Jun could order pasta, but he can't, so he must order salad.\n   - If Kira didn't order sushi, but she does, so others adjust accordingly.\n   - If Lev could order salad, but he can't, so he must order pasta.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**  \n   We check for logical fallacies:\n   - No fallacies detected in the reasoning. Each step follows logically without contradiction.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**  \n   After thorough analysis, we conclude:\n   - Jun orders salad.\n   - Kira orders sushi.\n   - Lev orders pasta.\n\n### Final Answer\n- **Jun** orders **salad**.\n- **Kira** orders **sushi**.\n- **Lev** orders **pasta**.\n```\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Define the possible dishes each person can order\npasta = ['Jun', 'Kira', 'Lev']\nsushi = ['Kira', 'Lev']\nsalad = ['Jun', 'Lev']\n\n# Define who can't order what\npasta_exclusion = {'Jun'}\nsushi_exclusion = {'Lev'}\nsalad_exclusion = {'Kira'}\n\n# Determine each person's dish based on the given conditions\n# Jun can't order pasta, so he must order salad or sushi\n# Kira orders sushi, so she doesn't order pasta or salad\n# Lev can't order salad, so he must order pasta or sushi\n\n# Assign based on the remaining options\njun = 'salad'  # Because Kira has taken sushi, and Lev can't take salad\nkira = 'sushi'\nlev = 'pasta'  # Because Lev can't take salad and sushi is taken by Kira\n```\n\n### Solution Code Explanation\nThe code defines possible dishes each person can order and who cannot order certain dishes based on the given conditions.
