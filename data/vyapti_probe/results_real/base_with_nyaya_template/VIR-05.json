Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n- **What is the question?** Identify the students who must attend study hall.\n- **What is the doubt?** Are all students who play sports and are not on the honor roll required to attend study hall?\n\n#### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n- **Vernacular Statement:** \"Students who play sports AND are NOT on the honor roll must attend study hall.\"\n- **Logical Translation:** If a student plays sports (A) and is not on the honor roll (not B), then they must attend study hall (C).\n\n#### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n- **Major Premise:** All students who play sports are in Set A.\n- **Minor Premise:** All students on the honor roll are in Set B.\n- **Conclusion:** Students who play sports and are not on the honor roll must attend study hall.\n\n#### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n- **If the policy didn't exist:** All students who play sports and are not on the honor roll could choose not to attend study hall.\n- **With the policy in place:** These students **must** attend study hall.\n\n#### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n- **Potential Fallacies:**\n  - **Equivocation:** Misinterpreting \"play sports\" as \"are in Set A.\"\n  - **Omission:** Forgetting that \"not on the honor roll\" is a necessary condition.\n- **Checked:** The statement is clear and unambiguous.\n\n#### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n- **Final Conclusion:** Students who play sports and are not on the honor roll must attend study hall.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe students who must attend study hall are those who play sports and are **not** on the honor roll. Specifically, they are:\n\n- **Students p, s, t**\n\n**Answer:** {p, s, t}",
