We have three Boolean variables P, Q, R, and the output OUT is defined by the logical expression (P AND Q) OR R. Given P is true, Q is false, and R is true, we need to compute the value of OUT.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The values of P, Q, and R are provided as true, false, and true respectively. These are our known facts.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** We apply the five-step syllogistic reasoning to evaluate the expression. First, evaluate the inner expression (P AND Q). Since P is true and Q is false, (P AND Q) evaluates to false. Then, we take this result and OR it with R. Since R is true, the final result is true.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** We consider what would happen if R were false. If R is false, then (P AND Q) OR R becomes (false) OR false, which evaluates to false. This shows that changing R affects the output.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** We check for any logical fallacies. In this case, the expression is a straightforward AND followed by an OR, which is a common logical structure and free from fallacies.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After evaluating all steps, we conclude that OUT is true and that changing R would change the output.\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n1. The value of OUT is **True**.\n2. Yes, changing R to false would cause OUT to change to **False**.\n```",
