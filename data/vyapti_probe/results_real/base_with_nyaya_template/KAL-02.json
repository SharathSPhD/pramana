Let me try to parse it.\n\nSo, the number is such that:\n\n1. It can be expressed as the sum of its own digits when each digit is squared.\n2. It can also be expressed as the sum of the squares of its digits when each digit is multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, for example, if the number is N, then:\n\nN = sum of (each digit squared)\nand\nN = sum of (each digit squared multiplied by 2)\n\nWait, that can't be, because if each digit squared is summed, and then each is multiplied by 2, the second sum would be double the first sum. So, unless the first sum is zero, which would make N=0, but that's trivial.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Is there a single number that can be expressed as the sum of its own digits when squared and also as the sum of the squares of its digits when multiplied by 2?\"\n\nSo, N = sum of (each digit squared) and N = sum of (each digit squared multiplied by 2).\n\nSo, that would mean sum of digits squared times 2 equals N, but N is also equal to sum of digits squared. That would only be possible if sum of digits squared is zero, which only happens if the number has no digits, which is not possible except for zero.\n\nBut zero is a single digit, so let's check:\n\nN=0.\n\nSum of digits squared: 0^2 = 0.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2: 0^2 * 2 = 0.\n\nSo, yes, 0 satisfies both conditions.\n\nBut maybe the problem is intended for positive integers. If so, then 0 is trivial. Let's see if there's another number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Maybe it's the sum of the squares of the digits when multiplied by 2, but perhaps the multiplication is per digit, then sum. So, for example, if the number is 12, then digits are 1 and 2.\n\nSum of digits squared: 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2: (1^2 * 2) + (2^2 * 2) = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nSo, 5 \u2260 10. So 12 doesn't work.\n\nAnother example: 0 works, but maybe 1?\n\nSum of digits squared: 1.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2: 2.\n\nSo, 1\u22602. Doesn't work.\n\nWhat about 2?\n\nSum of digits squared: 4.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2: 8.\n\n4\u22608.\n\nSimilarly, 3: 9 vs 18.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe the number has multiple digits, but perhaps the sum of squares times 2 equals the sum of squares.\n\nSo, sum of squares * 2 = sum of squares.\n\nWhich implies sum of squares = 0, which again only 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the only number is 0.\n\nBut maybe the problem is phrased differently. Let me read again.\n\n\"Is there a single number that can be expressed as the sum of its own digits when squared and also as the sum of the squares of its digits when multiplied by 2?\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's the sum of the digits when each digit is squared, and the sum of the squares of each digit when each is multiplied by 2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, N = sum(digits^2) and N = sum(2*(digits^2)).\n\nSo, N must equal 2*sum(digits^2) and also N = sum(digits^2). So, sum(digits^2) must be zero, which only happens if all digits are zero, i.e., N=0.\n\nTherefore, the only number is 0.\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the problem is that the number can be expressed as the sum of its digits when squared, and also as the sum of the squares of its digits when multiplied by 2, but perhaps the multiplication is per digit before squaring.\n\nWait, that would be different. Let me think.\n\nIf it's the sum of the digits when each digit is squared, that's sum(digits^2).\n\nAnd the sum of the squares of each digit when multiplied by 2, which would be sum((digit*2)^2).\n\nSo, N = sum(digits^2) and N = sum((digit*2)^2).\n\nSo, for example, for N=0, it's 0=0 and 0=0.\n\nFor N=1: sum(digits^2)=1, sum((1*2)^2)=4. So 1\u22604.\n\nFor N=2: sum=4, sum(4)=16. 4\u226016.\n\nFor N=5: sum=25, sum(10^2)=100. 25\u2260100.\n\nWait, that's different. So, perhaps the problem is that.\n\nSo, N = sum of digits squared, and N = sum of (digit*2)^2.\n\nSo, N = sum(digits^2) and N = sum(4*digit^2).\n\nSo, N must equal both sum(digits^2) and 4*sum(digits^2). So, sum(digits^2) must be zero, which again only happens if N=0.\n\nTherefore, the only number is 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended differently. Maybe the sum of the digits when each digit is squared, and the sum of the squares of the digits when each digit is multiplied by 2, but perhaps the multiplication is applied before squaring. Wait, that's the same as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number can be expressed as the sum of its digits when each digit is squared, and also as the sum of the squares of its digits when each digit is multiplied by 2, but perhaps the multiplication is per digit before squaring, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number is the sum of its digits when each digit is squared, and also the sum of the squares of its digits when each digit is multiplied by 2, but perhaps the multiplication is applied to the entire sum of squares.\n\nWait, that would be different. So, N = sum(digits^2) and N = (sum(digits^2)) * 2.\n\nSo, N = sum(digits^2) and N = 2*sum(digits^2).\n\nWhich again implies sum(digits^2)=0, so N=0.\n\nSo, regardless of interpretation, the only number that satisfies both conditions is 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have a positive integer solution. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's try N=0.\n\nDigits: 0.\n\nSum of digits squared: 0.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2: 0.\n\nSo, yes, 0 works.\n\nIs there any other number?\n\nLet me think of N=1.\n\nSum of digits squared:1.\n\nSum of squares multiplied by 2:2.\n\n1\u22602.\n\nN=2: sum=4, sum*2=8. 4\u22608.\n\nN=3:9 vs 18.\n\nN=4:16 vs32.\n\nN=5:25 vs50.\n\nN=6:36 vs72.\n\nN=7:49 vs98.\n\nN=8:64 vs128.\n\nN=9:81 vs162.\n\nN=10:1+0=1, and (1^2*2)+(0^2*2)=2+0=2. 1\u22602.\n\nN=11:1+1=2, and (1*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=4+4=8. 2\u22608.\n\nN=12:1+4=5, and (2*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=16+4=20. 5\u226020.\n\nN=13:1+9=10, and (3*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=36+4=40. 10\u226040.\n\nN=14:1+16=17, and (4*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=64+4=68. 17\u226068.\n\nN=15:1+25=26, and (5*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=100+4=104. 26\u2260104.\n\nN=16:1+36=37, and (6*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=144+4=148. 37\u2260148.\n\nN=17:1+49=50, and (7*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=196+4=200. 50\u2260200.\n\nN=18:1+64=65, and (8*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=256+4=260. 65\u2260260.\n\nN=19:1+81=82, and (9*2)^2 + (1*2)^2=324+4=328. 82\u2260328.\n\nN=20:4+0=4, and (2*2)^2 + (0*2)^2=16+0=16. 4\u226016.\n\nN=21:4+1=5,",
