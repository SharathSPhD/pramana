  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nThe system administrator is uncertain whether the backup system will activate based on the server's condition. Specifically, the administrator knows that the server is overloaded, but the network is functioning properly. The administrator needs to determine if the overload of the server alone is sufficient to trigger the backup system.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\n- The server is overloaded.\n- The network is operational.\n- The backup system is designed to activate under certain conditions.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n**Major Premise:** If the server is overloaded **OR** the network is down, the backup system activates.\n\n**Minor Premise:** The server is overloaded.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the syllogism, the backup system should activate because the server being overloaded satisfies the condition for activation.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nIf the server were not overloaded, but the network were down, the backup system would activate. Conversely, if the server is overloaded, regardless of the network status, the backup system activates.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nThere is no fallacy in the reasoning. The syllogism correctly applies the logical \"OR\" condition.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nBased on the analysis, the backup system does indeed activate when the server is overloaded, regardless of the network status.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the backup system activates.}}",
