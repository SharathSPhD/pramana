The riddle is presented in a way that is confusing or paradoxical, leading to doubt.\n\nThe riddle is: \"What is the smallest number that is bigger than any even number?\" \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The question is asking for a number that is bigger than every even number. Since even numbers go on infinitely (2, 4, 6, 8, ...), there isn't a largest even number. Therefore, it's impossible to have a number that is bigger than all of them. This leads to a state of doubt.\n\nSo, the first phase, Samshaya, involves recognizing that this is a paradox because no such number exists.\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nTo resolve the doubt, we need to look for sources of knowledge. The riddle is based on logical reasoning, so we should consider mathematical definitions.\n\nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. The set of even numbers is infinite: 2, 4, 6, 8, ... There is no maximum even number because for any even number n, n+2 is also even and larger.\n\nTherefore, there cannot be a number that is bigger than all even numbers. This means the answer is that no such number exists.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can apply the five-member syllogism to analyze the problem.\n\nPremise 1: All even numbers are divisible by 2.\nPremise 2: There are infinitely many even numbers.\nPremise 3: If a number is bigger than all even numbers, it must be larger than any even number.\nPremise 4: For any even number, adding 2 to it results in another even number.\nPremise 5: Therefore, there is no number that is bigger than all even numbers.\n\nThis syllogism shows that no finite number can be larger than all even numbers because the even numbers can always be increased by 2 to find a larger one.\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nLet's consider counterfactuals. Suppose there is a number N that is bigger than every even number. Then, for every even number E, N > E must hold.\n\nBut since the even numbers are infinite, for any N, there exists an even number E = N + 2, which is larger than N. This contradicts the assumption that N is bigger than every even number. Therefore, no such N exists.\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. The fallacy here might be assuming that a largest even number exists, which it doesn't because the set is infinite. Therefore, the conclusion that no such number exists is valid.\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nAfter analyzing through all phases, we conclude that there is no smallest number bigger than any even number because the set of even numbers is unbounded above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{There is no such number.}\n</think>\n\nThe puzzle presented is a riddle asking, \"What is the smallest number that is bigger than any even number?\" \n\n### Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem is paradoxical because it asks for a number that is bigger than every even number. Since even numbers are infinite (2, 4, 6, 8, ...), there isn't a largest even number. This leads to doubt.\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nAn even number is any integer divisible by 2. The set of even numbers is infinite, meaning there is no maximum even number. Therefore, no number can be bigger than all even numbers.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n- Premise 1: All even numbers are divisible by 2.\n- Premise 2: There are infinitely many even numbers.\n- Premise 3: If a number is bigger than all even numbers, it must be larger than any even number.\n- Premise 4: For any even number, adding 2 results in another even number.\n- Premise 5: Therefore, there is no number bigger than all even numbers.\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nAssuming a number \\( N \\) is bigger than every even number, there exists an even number \\( E = N + 2 \\), which is larger than \\( N \\). This contradiction shows no such \\( N \\) exists.\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nThe fallacy is assuming a largest even number exists. Since it doesn't, the conclusion is valid.\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nAfter analysis, there is no smallest number bigger than any even number because the set is unbounded.\n\n\\boxed{There is no such number.}",
