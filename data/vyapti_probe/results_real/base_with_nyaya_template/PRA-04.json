For the first question, it uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from City A to City D. For the second question, it checks if there is any overlap between the nodes of the shortest path from A to D and the shortest path from E to G by finding the intersection of the two sets of nodes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately determine the minimum travel time and check for any shared nodes between the two routes.\n```\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, List\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a graph with cities as nodes and routes as edges\n    graph = nx.Graph()\n    graph.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=2)\n    graph.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=3)\n    graph.add_edge('C', 'D', weight=1)\n    graph.add_edge('E', 'F', weight=4)\n    graph.add_edge('F', 'G', weight=2)\n    \n    # Question 1: Minimum travel time from A to D\n    # Use Dijkstra's algorithm\n    shortest_path = nx.dijkstra(graph, 'A', 'D')\n    print(f\"Shortest distance from A to D: {shortest_path['distance']}\")\n    \n    # Question 2: Are A-D and E-G routes connected?\n    # Check if the two paths share any common nodes\n    path_a_d = nx.shortest_path(graph, 'A', 'D')\n    path_e_g = nx.shortest_path(graph, 'E', 'G')\n    \n    # Check if there's any overlap between the two paths\n    common_nodes = set(path_a_d).intersection(set(path_e_g))\n    if common_nodes:\n        print(\"There is a common node in the A-D and E-G routes.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"There is no common node between the A-D and E-G routes.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code creates a graph of cities connected by train routes with specific travel times.
