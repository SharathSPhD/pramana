Let's go through each phase step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\n**Question:**  \nIf a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.  \nStudent X has passed the final exam.  \nWhat can we conclude about Student X's homework?\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\n**Step 2:**  \nWe need to identify the valid sources of knowledge for this statement.  \n- The statement is based on the school's established rule.  \n- Student X has passed the final exam, as given.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe information provided is sufficient to analyze the statement.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\n**Step 3:**  \nLet's structure the syllogism using the five parts:\n\n1. **Major Premise:**  \n   If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.\n\n2. **Minor Premise:**  \n   Student X has passed the final exam.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   Therefore, Student X has completed all homework assignments.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe syllogism is valid because the relationship between the major premise and the minor premise is clear and direct.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\n**Step 4:**  \nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to ensure the validity of our conclusion.\n\n- **Counterfactual 1:**  \n  What if Student X did not complete all homework assignments but still passed the final exam?  \n  - This contradicts the major premise, so it's not possible under the given rule.\n\n- **Counterfactual 2:**  \n  What if the rule is misinterpreted?  \n  - The rule explicitly states that passing the final exam implies completion of all homework assignments, so misinterpretation doesn't affect the conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe conclusion holds under all possible interpretations.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n**Step 5:**  \nWe need to check for any logical fallacies in the syllogism.\n\n- **Fallacy Type:** Heterogeneous Premise (Mixing different types of premises).  \n  - Here, the major premise is a conditional statement, and the minor premise is a specific case. This is acceptable in syllogistic reasoning.\n\n- **Fallacy Type:** Affirming the Consequent (Drawing a conclusion about the antecedent from the consequent).  \n  - In this case, we correctly derived the conclusion from the premise, so there's no fallacy.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo fallacies are present in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\n**Step 6:**  \nBased on the above analysis, we can confidently conclude that:\n\n- **If** Student X has passed the final exam,  \n- **Then** Student X has completed all homework assignments.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nStudent X has completed all homework assignments.",
