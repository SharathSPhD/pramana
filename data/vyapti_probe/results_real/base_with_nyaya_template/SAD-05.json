Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\n\nWe start by understanding the recursive formula. The function \\( f(n) \\) depends on itself, which seems unusual. Let's write out the formula for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( f(2) = f(1) + f(2) \\)\n\nWe know that \\( f(1) = 1 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( f(2) = 1 + f(2) \\)\n\nThis equation suggests that \\( f(2) \\) is equal to itself plus 1, which implies:\n\n\\( f(2) - f(2) = 1 \\)\n\n\\( 0 = 1 \\)\n\nThis is a contradiction, indicating an error in the recursive formula.\n\n### 2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n\nTo resolve the contradiction, we need to verify the problem statement. The recursive formula provided is:\n\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n) \\) for \\( n > 1 \\)\n\nUpon closer examination, the formula for \\( n > 1 \\) is incorrect. Typically, recursive functions are defined in terms of previous values, not the current value. A common recursive formula might be:\n\n- \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant.\n\nAssuming the intended formula is:\n\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 \\) for \\( n > 1 \\)\n\nThis makes more sense and aligns with standard recursive sequences.\n\n### 3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n\nLet's apply the five-member syllogism to validate our corrected formula:\n\n1. **Thesis**: \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n2. **Hypothesis**: For \\( n > 1 \\), \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 \\)\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \\( f(2) = f(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\n### 4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n\nWe need to ensure that our conclusion is logical. If the original formula were correct, \\( f(2) \\) would lead to a contradiction. By revising the formula, we avoid this inconsistency.\n\n### 5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n\nChecking for fallacies:\n- **Affirming the Falsity**: We correctly identified the contradiction in the original formula.\n- **Denying the Truth**: We acknowledged the corrected formula to resolve the contradiction.\n\n### 6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n\nAfter thorough analysis, we conclude that the correct value of \\( f(2) \\) is:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\( f(2) = 2 \\)",
