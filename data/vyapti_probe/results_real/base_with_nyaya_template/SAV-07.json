It first verifies that all compounds containing element X react (if acidic) or do not react (if basic). Then, it ensures that compounds without element X do not react. If any of these conditions are violated, the function returns `False`, indicating the rule is invalid. Otherwise, it returns `True`, confirming the rule's validity.\n```\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the rule proposed by the researcher is valid based on the given data. The rule is: \"All compounds containing element X undergo this reaction.\" Let me break this down step by step using the Nyaya methodology.\n\nFirst, I'll start with Samshaya, which is about raising doubts. So, I should question whether the rule is always true based on the data provided. Let's look at the compounds:\n\n- \u03b1: Contains X, acidic \u2192 Reacts \u2713\n- \u03b2: Contains X, acidic \u2192 Reacts \u2713\n- \u03b3: Contains X, basic \u2192 Does NOT react \u2717\n- \u03b4: Contains X, acidic \u2192 Reacts \u2713\n- \u03b5: Contains X, acidic \u2192 Reacts \u2713\n- \u03b6: Does NOT contain X, acidic \u2192 Does NOT react \u2717\n\nHmm, so for compounds containing X, some react and some don't. Specifically, \u03b3 doesn't react even though it has X. That's a problem because the rule says all X-containing compounds react. So, this seems like a counterexample. But wait, \u03b3 is basic. The rule says if a compound contains X, it reacts, but maybe it depends on whether it's acidic or basic. Oh, but the rule doesn't specify that; it just says \"reacts\" without considering the nature of the compound. So, the rule might be incorrect because \u03b3 doesn't react despite containing X.\n\nMoving on to Pramana, which is about the sources of knowledge. The data comes from experiments, so the observations are the sources. There's no indication of any error in the experiments, so the data seems reliable.\n\nNext is Pancha Avayava, the five-member syllogism. Let me try to structure this. The rule is a general statement: All X-containing compounds react. To test this, I need to see if all X-containing compounds do indeed react. From the data, \u03b3 is an X-containing compound that doesn't react. So, this syllogism would be invalid because the conclusion isn't always true.\n\nTarka is about counterfactual reasoning. So, I should consider if the rule holds even if one case doesn't. If \u03b3 is an exception, then the rule isn't universally true. Therefore, the rule isn't valid because it fails for \u03b3.\n\nHetvabhasa is checking for fallacies. The fallacy here might be an incorrect major premise. The major premise is that all X-containing compounds react, but \u03b3 contradicts this, making the syllogism fallacious.\n\nFinally, Nirnaya is about ascertaining the truth. After analyzing, it's clear that \u03b3 is a counterexample. Therefore, the rule isn't valid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the rule is invalid because there's at least one compound (\u03b3) that contains X but doesn't react. The presence of this exception means the general rule doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe rule is invalid because there exists a compound (\u03b3) that contains element X but does not react, serving as a counterexample.\n\n**Answer:** The rule is invalid because \u03b3, which contains X, does not react.",
