  "raw_response": "</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem using the **Nyaya methodology** to determine if the clerk's rule is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\nThe clerk observes that all Heavy packages cost $15 to ship. However, we need to verify this based on the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\nThe shipping costs provided are:\n\n- **Heavy, Domestic**: $15\n- **Heavy, International**: $15\n- **Light, Domestic**: $8\n- **Light, International**: $12\n\nFrom this, it appears that **all Heavy packages**, regardless of destination, cost $15. There are no instances of Heavy packages costing differently.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\nThe syllogism is structured as follows:\n\n1. **Major Premise**: All Heavy packages cost $15.\n2. **Minor Premise**: All the given Heavy packages cost $15.\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the rule is correct.\n\nThis syllogism holds because the minor premise aligns with the major premise.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\nLet's consider if there's any scenario where the rule might not hold:\n\n- If a Heavy package were to cost something other than $15, the rule would be invalid.\n- However, based on the data provided, there are no such cases.\n\nThus, the counterfactual reasoning supports the clerk's rule.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\nWe need to ensure the rule isn't based on any logical fallacies:\n\n- **Affirming the Negative**: The clerk is not denying any Heavy package costs $15; they are asserting it.\n- **Denying the Affirmative**: There's no evidence to suggest any Heavy package costs differently.\n- **Fourfold Figure**: The classification is straightforward (Heavy vs. Light, Domestic vs. International).\n\nThe rule does not fall into any logical fallacies.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **All Heavy packages in the data cost $15.**\n- **There are no exceptions or counterexamples.**\n\nTherefore, the clerk's rule is **correct**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The rule is correct.}}",
