  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step using the **Nyaya** methodology.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nThe statement asserts that **\"All the lights in Room A are on.\"**  \n- **What is being asked?**  \n  We need to determine which of the given options **MUST** be true.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n- The statement is presented as a fact, so we assume it is true unless proven otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nThe syllogism can be represented as:\n1. **All lights in Room A are on.**  \n   - **Major Premise:** All P are Q (All lights are on).\n2. **Lights are things that are on.**  \n   - **Minor Premise:** S is P (Lights are things that are on).\n3. **Therefore, S is Q.**  \n   - **Conclusion:** Lights are on.\n\nThis syllogism is **valid** because it follows the structure of a **Darii** (a type of syllogism).\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nLet's consider counterexamples to test the validity of the statement:\n- **If all lights in Room A are on, then at least one light must be on.**  \n  This is inherently true because if all are on, then each one is on.\n- **If all lights in Room A are on, then no lights in Room A are off.**  \n  This is also true because if all are on, none can be off.\n\nThus, the statement holds under counterfactual analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n- **Fallacy of Omission:** Missing a necessary condition.  \n  - The statement does not provide information about the number of lights, but it asserts that all are on.\n- **Fallacy of Ampliation:** Overstepping the given information.  \n  - The statement does not imply that all lights in other rooms are off.\n\nNeither fallacy applies here.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nBased on the analysis:\n- **(a) At least one light in Room A is on.**  \n  This must be true because if all are on, then certainly at least one is on.\n- **(b) No lights in Room A are off.**  \n  This must also be true because if all are on, none are off.\n- **(c) Both (a) and (b).**  \n  This is a combination of the above two points and is also true.\n- **(d) Neither (a) nor (b).**  \n  This is false because both (a) and (b) must be true.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\boxed{(c) Both (a) and (b).}",
