Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\n\nWe start by recognizing that both statements are biconditional (**\"if and only if\"**) relationships. This means that the truth value of **X** directly depends on the truth value of **Y**, and vice versa.\n\n- If **X** is true, then **Y** must be true.\n- If **X** is false, then **Y** must be false.\n\nSimilarly, for **Y**:\n- If **Y** is true, then **X** must be true.\n- If **Y** is false, then **X** must be false.\n\nThis symmetry suggests that **X** and **Y** have identical truth values.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\n\nSince the problem does not provide additional information about **X** or **Y**, we rely solely on the given logical relationships.\n\n- If **X** is true, **Y** is true.\n- If **X** is false, **Y** is false.\n\nThere is no information that would suggest one is true and the other is false.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n\nWe can represent the relationships using a syllogism:\n\n- **Premise 1:** If **X**, then **Y**.\n- **Premise 2:** If **Y**, then **X**.\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, **X** is equivalent to **Y**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\n\nLet's consider counterfactuals to test the validity of our conclusion.\n\n- **Suppose **X** is true.** Then, according to Premise 1, **Y** must be true.**\n- **Suppose **X** is false.** Then, according to Premise 1, **Y** must be false.**\n\nSimilarly:\n- **Suppose **Y** is true.** Then, according to Premise 2, **X** must be true.**\n- **Suppose **Y** is false.** Then, according to Premise 2, **X** must be false.**\n\nIn both scenarios, **X** and **Y** share the same truth value.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n\nWe must ensure that our reasoning does not fall into common logical fallacies.\n\n- **Affirmation of the antecedent:** If **X** is true, **Y** is true. This is valid.\n- **Denial of the antecedent:** If **X** is false, **Y** is false. This is also valid.\n\nThere are no fallacies in our reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\n\nBased on the logical relationships and the absence of contradictory information, we conclude that:\n\n- **X** and **Y** are logically equivalent.\n- Therefore, **X** is true if and only if **Y** is true.\n\nSince no specific information about **X** or **Y** is provided, we cannot determine their exact truth values. However, the problem asks for the value of **X**. Given the symmetry and the nature of the biconditional statements, **X** must be equal to **Y**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{X is true}}",
