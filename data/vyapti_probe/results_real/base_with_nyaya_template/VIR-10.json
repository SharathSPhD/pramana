Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\n**Question:**  \nDoes Contestant M qualify for the prize if they have solved both Problem A and Problem B?\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe contest rule states that a contestant must solve **either** Problem A **or** Problem B to win a prize. Contestant M has solved both problems. The question is whether solving both satisfies the condition of solving \"either\" of the problems.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat are the sources of knowledge about the contest rule?\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe source is the contest rule itself, which specifies that solving **either** Problem A **or** Problem B is required.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\n**Syllogism Structure:**  \n1. **Major Premise:** A contestant must solve Problem A **or** Problem B to win.  \n2. **Minor Premise:** Contestant M has solved both Problem A and Problem B.  \n3. **Conclusion:** Does Contestant M qualify for the prize?\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe syllogism is valid because solving both satisfies the condition of solving **either**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat if Contestant M only solved one problem?\n\n**Answer:**  \nIf Contestant M had solved only one problem, they would still qualify because the rule allows for **either** problem. However, since they solved both, they still satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n**Question:**  \nIs there any fallacy in the reasoning?\n\n**Answer:**  \nNo fallacy is present. The reasoning is logical and consistent with the given rule.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nContestant M qualifies for the prize because solving both Problem A and Problem B fulfills the requirement of solving **either** Problem A **or** Problem B.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}",
