  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are tasked with determining whether the librarian's statement, \"All our recommended books are available,\" is true based on the given information.\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nThe librarian expresses doubt about the statement. We need to analyze if there's any reason to believe that not all recommended books are available.\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\nThe information provided is from the library catalog system, which is a reliable source. Therefore, we can trust the tags assigned to each book.\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\nLet's break down the syllogism:\n\n- **Major Premise:** All recommended books are available. (Librarian's statement)\n- **Minor Premise:** All the listed books are recommended. (From the catalog)\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, all the listed books are available.\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nWe need to consider if there are any exceptions or counterexamples. Looking at the list:\n\n- **\"Algorithms\"** \u2013 [Recommended] [Available] [New Arrival]\n- **\"Bioinformatics\"** \u2013 [Recommended] [Available] [New Arrival]\n- **\"Compilers\"** \u2013 [Recommended] [Available]\n- **\"Databases\"** \u2013 [Recommended] [Available] [New Arrival]\n- **\"Encryption\"** \u2013 [Recommended] [Available] [New Arrival]\n- **\"Fractals\"** \u2013 [Available] [New Arrival]\n\nAll recommended books are also marked as available. There are no books in the list that are recommended but not available.\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nWe need to check for logical fallacies. The statement is a universal affirmative (\"All recommended books are available\"). Since there are no exceptions in the list, the fallacy check confirms the statement's validity.\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nAfter analyzing all phases, we conclude that the librarian's statement is true.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the statement is true.}}",
