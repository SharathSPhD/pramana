The product is rejected if both Test-A and Test-B must pass. Since the product passes Test-A but fails Test-B, it does not satisfy both conditions, hence it is rejected.\n```\nTest-A: True\nTest-B: False\nTest-A \u2227 Test-B: True \u2227 False \u2192 False\n\u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B): True\nThus, the product is rejected.\n```\n### Final Answer\nThe product is rejected.\n```\nThe product is rejected.\n```\n</div>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the product P is rejected based on the given condition. So, the problem says that a product is rejected if it's NOT the case that both Test-A and Test-B pass. In other words, the product is rejected when either Test-A fails, or Test-B fails, or both.\n\nNow, according to the problem, Product P has passed Test-A but failed Test-B. So, Test-A is True, and Test-B is False. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the condition for rejection. The system rejects the product if it's NOT both Test-A and Test-B passing. Symbolically, that's \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, if either Test-A is false, or Test-B is false, or both, the product is rejected.\n\nIn this case, Test-A is true, but Test-B is false. So, let's compute Test-A \u2227 Test-B. That would be True \u2227 False, which is False. Then, the negation of that, \u00ac(False), is True. So, the product is rejected because the condition for rejection is met.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes logical negations can be tricky. So, \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB. That is, either A is false, or B is false, or both. So, in our case, since B is false, regardless of A, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the product is indeed rejected.\n\nI think I got it right. The key here is understanding that the product fails the second test, so even though it passed the first, it doesn't meet both required conditions, leading to rejection.\n</div>\nOkay, so I need to determine if Product P is rejected based on the given condition. Let me go through each step of the Nyaya methodology to analyze this problem thoroughly.\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** I'm a bit confused about how the rejection works. The problem states that the product is rejected if it's NOT the case that both Test-A and Test-B pass. So, the product is rejected when either one of them fails, or both. But I need to confirm if this is the correct understanding.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information given is that Test-A passed and Test-B failed. So, Test-A is True, and Test-B is False. These are the facts we have to work with.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** This is about constructing a syllogism. Let me try to frame the problem in terms of a syllogism. The major premise is that a product is rejected if both tests pass. The minor premise is that Product P passed Test-A but failed Test-B. So, combining these, we can conclude that Product P is rejected because it didn't pass both tests.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** Let's consider the counterfactual. If both tests passed, the product wouldn't be rejected. But since Test-B failed, the product is indeed rejected. This makes sense because the condition requires both tests to pass for acceptance.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** I need to check if there's any fallacy in the reasoning. The fallacy here would be if I assumed that both tests must pass for rejection, but the problem clearly states that the product is rejected if it's NOT the case that both pass. So, no fallacy seems present.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After analyzing all aspects, it's clear that since Test-B failed, the product meets the rejection condition. Therefore, the product is rejected.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps.
