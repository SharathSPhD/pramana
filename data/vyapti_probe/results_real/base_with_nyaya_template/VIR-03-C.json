  "raw_response": "---\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if Student Y received a scholarship based on the given information. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the statement says, \"Every student who scored above 90 on the test received a scholarship.\" So, this is a universal statement. It's saying that if you scored above 90, you got a scholarship. Now, Student Y scored 95. I need to determine if this necessarily means Y got a scholarship.\n\nLet me break it down using the Nyaya methodology.\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** I'm a bit confused because the statement is general. It says every student above 90 gets a scholarship, but does that mean every student below 90 doesn't? Or are there exceptions? I'm not sure. Maybe some students might still get scholarships for other reasons, but according to the given statement, it's only based on the score. So, if someone scored above 90, they definitely got it, but scoring below doesn't automatically mean they didn't. There could be other factors, but the statement doesn't specify.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information comes from the test scores and the scholarship policy. The test score is a direct observation, and the policy is a known rule. So, these are reliable sources.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** This involves the major premise, minor premise, conclusion, premises, and conclusion. Let me structure this.\n\n- **Major Premise:** Every student who scored above 90 received a scholarship.\n- **Minor Premise:** Student Y scored 95.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, Student Y received a scholarship.\n\nSo, the syllogism makes sense. If the major premise is true, and the minor premise is true, then the conclusion follows.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** Let me consider if the conclusion holds under all circumstances. If Student Y scored above 90, they must have received a scholarship. There's no exception mentioned, so the conclusion should hold.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** I need to check for any logical fallacies. The statement is a universal affirmative (\"Every student...\"), which is a strong statement. It doesn't use any middle terms that could cause confusion. The syllogism follows the major and minor premises correctly, so no fallacies here.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After analyzing all aspects, the conclusion is that Student Y did receive a scholarship because 95 is above 90, and the policy applies universally.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if the statement is absolute. What if the scholarship is limited? But the problem doesn't state that. It just says every student above 90 got one. So, no, there's no limitation implied.\n\nAnother thought: could there be other criteria for scholarships? The statement doesn't mention anything else, so we have to go by what's given. So, scoring above 90 is the sole criterion.\n\nTherefore, based on the Nyaya steps, the conclusion is that Student Y did receive a scholarship.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nYes, Student Y received a scholarship because scoring 95 meets the criterion of scoring above 90, as per the given policy.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** The initial confusion is whether the statement's conditions are absolute or if there are exceptions. However, the statement specifies that every student above 90 received a scholarship, implying no exceptions are known.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** Reliable sources include the test score (95) and the scholarship policy stating scores above 90 qualify.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (Syllogism):**\n   - **Major Premise:** All students with scores >90 received scholarships.\n   - **Minor Premise:** Y scored 95 (>90).\n   - **Conclusion:** Y received a scholarship.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual):** Considering if Y had scored exactly 90 or below, they wouldn't qualify. Since Y scored above 90, the conclusion holds.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** The syllogism avoids fallacies as it correctly applies a universal affirmative premise.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After thorough analysis, the conclusion is confirmed\u2014Student Y received a scholarship.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Student Y received a scholarship.",
