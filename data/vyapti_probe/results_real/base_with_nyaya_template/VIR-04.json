The policy explicitly states they would not.\n   - Since Employee Z has completed the training, the opposite does not apply.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n   - The statement does not contain any logical fallacies. The syllogism is valid.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\n   - Based on the valid syllogism and the given information, it is certain that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{Yes}",
