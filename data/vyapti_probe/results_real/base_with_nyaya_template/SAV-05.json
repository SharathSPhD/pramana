Anita, Bhaskar, Chandra, Deepak, Ekta, and Faizan each report to a specific manager.\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** We analyze the relationships step by step.\n   - VP-Sales and VP-Engineering and VP-Finance report to the CEO.\n   - Director-Operations reports to COO, not to any VP.\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** Consider if Ekta's manager (COO) reports to the CEO. Since COO is a separate role, Ekta does not report to the CEO.\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** Ensure no fallacies in reasoning. Ekta's manager is COO, who is not under the CEO's direct reports.\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** Conclusion: Ekta does not report to the CEO, while others do.\n\nThus, the final answer is that Ekta does NOT report to the CEO.\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nAnita, Bhaskar, Chandra, Deepak, and Faizan all report to the CEO, but Ekta does NOT report to the CEO.\n```\n\n### Output\nThe output of the Python code confirms the above conclusion.\n```\nAnita reports to CEO.\nBhaskar reports to CEO.\nChandra reports to CEO.\nDeepak reports to CEO.\nEkta does NOT report to CEO.\nFaizan reports to CEO.\n```\n</div>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether every employee listed in the corporate hierarchy ultimately reports to the CEO. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the employees mentioned: Anita, Bhaskar, Chandra, Deepak, Ekta, and Faizan. Each of them reports to someone else in the company. \n\nThe problem states that anyone who reports to a VP also reports indirectly to the CEO because VPs are part of the CEO's direct reports. So, if someone reports to a VP, they're connected to the CEO through that chain.\n\nLet's break down each employee:\n\n1. **Anita**: She reports to VP-Sales. Since VP-Sales is a direct report of the CEO, Anita indirectly reports to the CEO through her manager.\n\n2. **Bhaskar**: Similar to Anita, he also reports to VP-Sales. So, he also indirectly reports to the CEO.\n\n3. **Chandra**: He reports to VP-Engineering. VP-Engineering is another direct report of the CEO, so Chandra's reporting path goes through VP-Engineering to the CEO.\n\n4. **Deepak**: He's under VP-Engineering as well, so same as Chandra. He indirectly reports to the CEO.\n\n5. **Ekta**: This one is a bit tricky. She reports to Director-Operations, who in turn reports to the COO, not to any VP. Now, the problem says that anyone who reports to a VP also reports indirectly to the CEO. But Ekta's manager is the COO, who isn't a VP. So, does the COO report to the CEO? The problem doesn't specify that, but typically in a corporate structure, the COO is a direct report of the CEO. However, the problem states that Ekta's manager (COO) doesn't report to any VP, but it doesn't explicitly say whether the COO reports to the CEO. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Ekta reports to Director-Operations, who reports to the COO, NOT to any VP.\" So, the COO is a separate reporting path. Now, does the COO report to the CEO? The problem doesn't mention that. So, if the COO doesn't report to the CEO, then Ekta doesn't either. But if the COO does report to the CEO, then Ekta would indirectly report to the CEO through the COO.\n\nHmm, the problem says that the COO is not a VP, so the initial statement about anyone who reports to a VP also reports to the CEO indirectly doesn't apply here. So, Ekta's reporting chain is Ekta \u2192 COO. If the COO is not under the CEO's direct reports, then Ekta doesn't report to the CEO.\n\n6. **Faizan**: He reports to VP-Finance, who is a direct report of the CEO. So, Faizan indirectly reports to the CEO.\n\nSo, putting it all together, all employees except Ekta report to the CEO either directly or indirectly. Ekta's manager is the COO, and since the problem doesn't state that the COO reports to the CEO, we can't assume that. Therefore, Ekta does not report to the CEO.\n\nWait, but in many corporate structures, the COO is a direct report of the CEO. So, maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that since the COO isn't a VP, Ekta doesn't report to the CEO. But if the COO does report to the CEO, then Ekta would indirectly report through the COO. However, the problem explicitly says that the COO doesn't report to any VP, but it doesn't say whether the COO reports to the CEO. So, without that information, we can't assume that the COO reports to the CEO.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, Ekta does not report to the CEO because her manager (COO) isn't a VP and there's no information that the COO reports to the CEO. So, the conclusion is that Ekta does not report to the CEO, while the others do.\n</div>\n\nThe final answer is that all employees except Ekta report to the CEO. Therefore, the conclusion is that Ekta does NOT report to the CEO, while the others do.",
