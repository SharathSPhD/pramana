The first statement defines X in terms of Y, stating that X is true if and only if Y is true. The second statement asserts that Y is true. Using the Nyaya methodology, we analyze the problem step-by-step. In Samshaya, we identify the doubt, which is whether X is true. In Pramana, we establish the premises as true sources. The Pancha Avayava syllogism helps structure the logical flow. Tarka involves considering counterfactuals to reinforce the conclusion. Hetvabhasa checks for fallacies, ensuring the logic is sound. Finally, Nirnaya confirms that X must be true based on the premises and logical reasoning.\n\nThe solution concludes that X is true because Y is true, and X is defined to be true if Y is true.\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # Samshaya: Doubt Analysis\n    # We have two variables, X and Y.\n    # The first statement says X is true if and only if Y is true.\n    # The second statement says Y is true.\n    # So, if Y is true, then X must be true.\n    # Therefore, X is true.\n\n    # Pramana: Sources of Knowledge\n    # The statements are given as premises, so they are the sources of knowledge.\n\n    # Pancha Avayava: 5-Member Syllogism\n    # 1. Premise 1: X iff Y\n    # 2. Premise 2: Y is true\n    # 3. Conclusion: X is true\n\n    # Tarka: Counterfactual Reasoning\n    # Suppose X is not true, then Y must be not true. But since Y is true, X must be true.\n\n    # Hetvabhasa: Fallacy Check\n    # The reasoning is correct. There are no fallacies present.\n\n    # Nirnaya: Ascertainment\n    # Based on the above analysis, X is definitely true.\n\n    return True\n```\n\nThe function `solve()` returns `True` because X is true if and only if Y is true, and Y is given as true. Therefore, X must be true.\n```",
