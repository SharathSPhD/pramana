  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe will analyze the problem using the **6-phase Nyaya methodology** to determine if the hypothesis \"Whenever S1 is ON, the light is ON\" is valid based on the given test results and the circuit manual.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\n- **Problem Statement:** The light turns ON if and only if S1 is ON (as per the manual). However, in **Test 5**, when S1 is OFF, the light is OFF. This seems contradictory because according to the manual, the light should only be ON when S1 is ON. But in all other tests, when S1 is ON, the light is ON, and when S1 is OFF, the light is OFF.\n\n- **Doubt:** Is the hypothesis \"Whenever S1 is ON, the light is ON\" valid?\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\n- **Manual:** \"The light turns ON if and only if S1 is ON.\"\n- **Test Results:**\n  - **Test 1:** S1=ON \u2192 Light ON\n  - **Test 2:** S1=ON \u2192 Light ON\n  - **Test 3:** S1=ON \u2192 Light ON\n  - **Test 4:** S1=ON \u2192 Light ON\n  - **Test 5:** S1=OFF \u2192 Light OFF\n- **Conclusion:** The manual and test results are consistent. Whenever S1 is ON, the light is ON, and when S1 is OFF, the light is OFF.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\nWe can frame the problem into a syllogism:\n\n- **Major Premise:** The light turns ON if and only if S1 is ON. (Manual)\n- **Minor Premise:** In Test 5, S1 is OFF.\n- **Conclusion:** The light turns OFF. (Test 5)\n\nThis syllogism aligns with the manual and test results, supporting the hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\n- **Counterfactual:** If S1 were ON, would the light be ON?\n  - According to the manual, yes. All tests confirm this.\n- **Conclusion:** The counterfactual holds true, supporting the hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n- **Fallacy Identification:** There is no apparent fallacy in the test results or manual. The data is consistent and supports the hypothesis.\n- **Conclusion:** No fallacies detected.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\n- **Final Determination:** Based on the manual, test results, syllogism, counterfactual reasoning, and fallacy check, the hypothesis \"Whenever S1 is ON, the light is ON\" is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the hypothesis is valid.}}",
