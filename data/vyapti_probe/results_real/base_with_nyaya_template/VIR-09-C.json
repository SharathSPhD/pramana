Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n- **What is the question?**  \n  Can we conclude that Case #247 is not classified as high-priority based on the absence of a senior partner?\n\n- **What is to be found out?**  \n  Whether the absence of a senior partner implies that the case is not high-priority.\n\n#### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n- **Policy Statement:**  \n  \"If a case is high-priority, then a senior partner is assigned.\"\n- **Case #247:**  \n  No senior partner is assigned.\n\n- **What is the evidence?**  \n  The absence of a senior partner.\n\n#### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n- **Major Premise:**  \n  If a case is high-priority, then a senior partner is assigned.\n- **Minor Premise:**  \n  A case is high-priority.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Therefore, a senior partner is assigned.\n\n**Applying to Case #247:**\n- **Major Premise:**  \n  If a case is high-priority, then a senior partner is assigned.\n- **Minor Premise:**  \n  Is Case #247 high-priority?\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  If yes, then a senior partner should be assigned.\n\nBut since no senior partner is assigned, we need to analyze further.\n\n#### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n- **Assume the opposite:**  \n  Suppose Case #247 **is** high-priority.\n- **Then, according to the policy, a senior partner should be assigned.**\n- **But in reality, no senior partner is assigned.**\n- **Therefore, our assumption is false.**\n- **Hence, Case #247 cannot be high-priority.**\n\n#### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n- **Identify the fallacy:**  \n  The policy does not state that **only** high-priority cases require senior partners. It could mean that senior partners are assigned **only** to high-priority cases.\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The reasoning holds as the absence of a senior partner correctly implies the case is not high-priority.\n\n#### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n- **Final Conclusion:**  \n  Yes, Case #247 is **not** classified as high-priority because no senior partner was assigned.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Yes}",
