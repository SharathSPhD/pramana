Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\n\nWe have three tasks (T1, T2, T3) and three time slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). The constraints are:\n- T1 must be scheduled immediately before T2.\n- T2 must be scheduled immediately before T3.\n- T3 must be scheduled immediately before T1.\n\nAt first glance, it seems challenging to satisfy all three constraints because each task depends on the next one in a cyclical manner.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\n\nLet's list all possible permutations of tasks and slots to understand the constraints better.\n\nThere are **6 possible permutations** for scheduling the tasks:\n\n1. **T1 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T1**\n2. **T1 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T1**\n3. **T2 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T2**\n4. **T2 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T2**\n5. **T3 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T3**\n6. **T3 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T3**\n\nNow, let's check which of these permutations satisfy all three constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n\nWe need to find a permutation where:\n- T1 is immediately before T2.\n- T2 is immediately before T3.\n- T3 is immediately before T1.\n\nLet's analyze each permutation:\n\n1. **T1 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T1**\n   - T1 is before T2.\n   - T2 is before T3.\n   - T3 is before T1.\n   - **All constraints are satisfied.**\n\n2. **T1 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T1**\n   - T1 is before T3.\n   - T3 is before T2.\n   - T2 is before T1.\n   - **Not all constraints are satisfied.**\n\n3. **T2 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T2**\n   - T2 is before T1.\n   - T1 is before T3.\n   - T3 is before T2.\n   - **Not all constraints are satisfied.**\n\n4. **T2 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T2**\n   - T2 is before T3.\n   - T3 is before T1.\n   - T1 is before T2.\n   - **Not all constraints are satisfied.**\n\n5. **T3 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T3**\n   - T3 is before T1.\n   - T1 is before T2.\n   - T2 is before T3.\n   - **Not all constraints are satisfied.**\n\n6. **T3 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T1 \u2192 T3**\n   - T3 is before T2.\n   - T2 is before T1.\n   - T1 is before T3.\n   - **Not all constraints are satisfied.**\n\nFrom the above analysis, only the **first permutation** satisfies all the constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\n\nLet's consider if there's any possibility of another valid permutation by altering the order.\n\nSuppose we try to place T1 in the Afternoon slot. Then:\n- T2 must be in the Evening slot (immediately after T1).\n- T3 must be in the next slot after T2, which would be the next day's Morning slot.\n- But T3 must also be immediately before T1, which is in the Afternoon slot. This creates a conflict because T3 cannot be in both the Evening and Morning slots simultaneously.\n\nSimilarly, placing T2 in the Evening slot leads to the same contradiction.\n\nThus, the only feasible arrangement is the one where the tasks cycle through Morning \u2192 Afternoon \u2192 Evening \u2192 Morning.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n\nWe need to ensure that our reasoning isn't flawed. Let's verify the constraints step-by-step:\n\n1. **T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, T3 in Evening:**\n   - T1 is before T2 (Morning \u2192 Afternoon).\n   - T2 is before T3 (Afternoon \u2192 Evening).\n   - T3 is before T1 (Evening \u2192 next Morning).\n   - **All constraints are satisfied.**\n\n2. **Alternative arrangement:**\n   - Suppose T1 is in the Evening slot.\n   - Then T2 must be in the next slot, which would be the next day's Morning slot.\n   - T3 must be in the slot after T2, which would be the Afternoon slot.\n   - However, T3 must also be before T1, which is in the Evening slot. This creates a circular dependency that cannot be resolved.\n\nThus, the initial arrangement is the only valid one.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\n\nAfter thorough analysis, the only valid schedule that satisfies all constraints is:\n\n- **T1 in Morning**\n- **T2 in Afternoon**\n- **T3 in Evening**\n\nThis ensures that each task is scheduled immediately before the next one, and the cycle continues correctly.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Morning: T1} \\\\\n&\\text{Afternoon: T2} \\\\\n&\\text{Evening: T3}\n\\end{aligned}\n}\n\\]",
