Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nWe have four researchers: Priya, Qadir, Ravi, and Sita. Each works in either **Lab-North** or **Lab-South**. The known information is:\n\n- **Priya** works in **Lab-North**.\n- **Qadir** works in **Lab-South**.\n- **Sita** works in **Lab-North**.\n- **Lab-South** has exactly **two researchers**.\n\n**What do we need to find?**\n- The lab where **Ravi** works.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\nWe rely on the given information as our source of knowledge.\n\n- **Priya**: Lab-North\n- **Qadir**: Lab-South\n- **Sita**: Lab-North\n- **Lab-South**: Exactly two researchers\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nWe can construct a syllogism to determine Ravi's lab.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. **Priya** and **Sita** work in **Lab-North**.\n2. **Qadir** works in **Lab-South**, and **Lab-South** has exactly two researchers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince **Lab-South** has exactly two researchers and **Qadir** is one of them, the other researcher in **Lab-South** must be **Ravi**. Therefore, **Ravi** works in **Lab-South**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nLet's consider if Ravi could be in **Lab-North**:\n- If **Ravi** were in **Lab-North**, then **Lab-South** would have only **Qadir**, which contradicts the given information that **Lab-South** has exactly two researchers.\n- Therefore, **Ravi** cannot be in **Lab-North**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nWe need to ensure our reasoning is free from fallacies:\n- **Affirming the Negative**: We correctly concluded that Ravi must be in **Lab-South** because **Lab-South** must have two researchers.\n- **Denying the Negative**: We correctly identified that Ravi cannot be in **Lab-North** due to the contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nAfter thorough analysis, we conclude that **Ravi** works in **Lab-South**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Lab-South}}",
