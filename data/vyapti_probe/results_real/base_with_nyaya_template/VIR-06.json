  "raw_response": "</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step using the **Nyaya** methodology.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\nThe statement is:  \n*\"It is false that all the lights in Room A are on.\"*\n\nThis means that it's not true that every single light in Room A is on. So, there is at least one light that is off.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The statement itself is a source of knowledge.\n- There is no additional information provided about the number of lights or their individual states.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\nThe syllogism can be represented as:\n1. All lights in Room A are on.  \n   *(This is the opposite of the given statement, which is false.)*\n2. If all lights are on, then all are on.  \n   *(A trivially true statement.)*\n3. It is false that all lights are on.  \n   *(Given statement.)*\n4. Therefore, it is not the case that all lights are on.  \n   *(Logical conclusion: At least one light is off.)*\n5. Hence, at least one light is off.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\nLet's consider the opposite:\n- Suppose all lights are on.  \n- Then, the statement \"It is false that all the lights in Room A are on\" would be **false**.  \n- But since the statement is given as **true**, our assumption is false.  \n- Therefore, not all lights can be on.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n- **Fallacy of Denial**: The statement does not deny the existence of any lights; it only claims that not all are on.\n- **Fallacy of Exclusion**: There is no information suggesting that any specific number of lights must be on or off.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The statement directly implies that **at least one light is off**.\n- None of the other options are necessarily true:\n  - **(a)** All lights being off is not specified.\n  - **(b)** At least one light off is the only certain conclusion.\n  - **(c)** No lights being on is too strong a statement.\n  - **(d)** Exactly half the lights being off is speculative.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{(b)}",
