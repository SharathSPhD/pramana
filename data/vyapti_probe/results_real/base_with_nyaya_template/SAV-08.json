The counselor claims that every Physics student has passed the exam. However, upon examining the data, we find that Durga, who studies Physics, failed the exam. Therefore, the counselor's statement is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** We have seven students, each assigned to one of three subjects. The counselor's statement is that all Physics students have passed. But we know that Durga, a Physics student, failed. This raises a doubt about the counselor's accuracy.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information provided about each student's subject and exam result is the primary source of knowledge. It directly indicates that Durga failed Physics.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** This step involves constructing a syllogism. Let's consider the subjects and results:\n   - Some students study Physics.\n   - Durga is one of these students.\n   - Durga failed the exam.\n   - Therefore, at least one Physics student failed.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If the counselor's statement were true, all Physics students would have passed. But since Durga failed, this scenario is impossible. Hence, the statement is false.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** The counselor's statement assumes that all Physics students passed without exception. However, Durga's failure is a clear counterexample, indicating a fallacy in the assumption.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After evaluating all steps, it's clear that the counselor's statement is inaccurate because Durga, a Physics student, failed the exam.\n\n**Conclusion:** The counselor's statement is not accurate because Durga, a Physics student, failed the exam.\n```",
