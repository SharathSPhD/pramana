Let's analyze the problem step-by-step using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nWe have seven students, each studying one of three subjects: Physics, Chemistry, or Biology. The students and their subjects are as follows:\n\n- **Arjun:** Physics\n- **Bhavya:** Chemistry\n- **Chirag:** Physics\n- **Durga:** Physics\n- **Emil:** Biology\n- **Fatima:** Physics\n- **Gopal:** Chemistry\n\nEach student has passed their respective exams. The department head states that \"Every Physics student in this cohort passed the exam.\" Our task is to verify if this statement is consistent with the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\nThe sources of knowledge here are the students' subjects and their exam results. We have direct information about each student's subject and their exam outcome.\n\n- **Arjun:** Physics (Passed)\n- **Bhavya:** Chemistry (Passed)\n- **Chirag:** Physics (Passed)\n- **Durga:** Physics (Passed)\n- **Emil:** Biology (Passed)\n- **Fatima:** Physics (Passed)\n- **Gopal:** Chemistry (Passed)\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nIn a syllogism, we have three terms: the subject (Physics), the predicate (Passed), and the middle term (students). The department head's statement can be represented as:\n\n- **All Physics students are in the cohort.**\n- **All Physics students in the cohort passed the exam.**\n- **Therefore, all Physics students in the cohort passed the exam.**\n\nThis is a valid syllogism based on the given data.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nWe need to consider if the statement could be false. Suppose not all Physics students passed the exam. However, the data shows that **all Physics students (Arjun, Chirag, Durga, Fatima)** passed their exams. There is no evidence or indication that any Physics student failed. Thus, the statement holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nWe need to check for any logical fallacies. The statement is a universal affirmative (\"Every Physics student...\") and is consistent with the data provided. There are no contradictions or missing information that would render this statement false.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nAfter analyzing all phases, we conclude that the department head's statement is consistent with the given data. **Every Physics student in the cohort did indeed pass the exam.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the department head's confirmation is consistent with the data.}}",
