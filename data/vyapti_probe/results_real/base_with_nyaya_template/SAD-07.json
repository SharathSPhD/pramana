This is a fundamental concept in number theory, as primes are the building blocks of integers. The proof provided attempts to show that assuming a prime greater than 2 is even leads to a contradiction, thereby proving that such primes must be odd.\n\n### **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\nThe sources of knowledge used in this proof are:\n- Definition of prime numbers.\n- Basic properties of even and odd numbers.\n- The divisibility rules and factors of numbers.\n\n### **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\nThe five-member syllogism used in the proof is:\n1. Let p be a prime number greater than 2.\n2. Assume p is even. Then p = 2k for some integer k > 1.\n3. Since p = 2k, p is divisible by 2.\n4. Since p > 2 and p is divisible by 2, p is not prime (because it has a factor other than 1 and itself).\n5. This contradicts premise 1 (p is prime).\n6. Therefore, p is not even, so p is odd.\n\n### **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\nThe proof uses counterfactual reasoning by assuming the opposite of what it wants to prove (that p is even) and then showing that this leads to a contradiction. This is a valid method in logical reasoning.\n\n### **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\nThe proof does not contain any fallacies. The argument is logical and follows the rules of inference correctly.\n\n### **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\nBased on the analysis, the proof is valid and correctly demonstrates that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe proof is valid. All prime numbers greater than 2 are indeed odd.",
