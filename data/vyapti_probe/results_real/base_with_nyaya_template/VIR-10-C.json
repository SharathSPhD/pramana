Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \nContestant M has solved Problem A but not Problem B. The question is whether solving either Problem A or Problem B is sufficient to win the prize.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \nThe contest rule is clear: solving **either** Problem A **or** Problem B is required. There are no additional conditions or exceptions mentioned.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \nLet's break down the syllogism:  \n- **Major Premise:** To win a prize, a contestant must solve Problem A **or** Problem B.  \n- **Minor Premise:** Contestant M has solved Problem A **but not** Problem B.  \n- **Conclusion:** Does Contestant M qualify for the prize?\n\nThe syllogism is valid because solving either Problem A **or** Problem B satisfies the condition for winning the prize.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \nIf Contestant M had not solved Problem A, they would not qualify. However, since they have solved Problem A, the counterfactual does not apply here.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \nThere are no logical fallacies in the given statement. The rule is straightforward and does not introduce any contradictions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \nBased on the analysis, Contestant M qualifies for the prize because solving Problem A satisfies the condition of solving **either** Problem A **or** Problem B.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}",
