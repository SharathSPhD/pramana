Each step systematically addresses the problem, starting from identifying the doubt, sourcing knowledge, applying a syllogism, considering counterfactuals, checking for fallacies, and finally concluding the result.\n```\n\n### Solution\n**Yes**\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** We are unsure whether Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus because we don't have direct information about his residence.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information comes from the given premises, which state that Rishi owns a bicycle and all bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (Syllogism):** Using the two premises, we can form a syllogism where the conclusion is that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus because he is a bicycle owner, and all such owners reside there.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If Rishi didn't own a bicycle, the premise doesn't apply, but since he does, the conclusion holds.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** We aren't assuming Rishi is a bicycle owner; we're using the premise that all owners are within 5 km.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Conclusion):** After evaluating all aspects, Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus.\n```\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Yes}\n</think>\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** We are unsure whether Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus because we don't have direct information about his residence.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information comes from the given premises, which state that Rishi owns a bicycle and all bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (Syllogism):** Using the two premises, we can form a syllogism where the conclusion is that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus because he is a bicycle owner, and all such owners reside there.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If Rishi didn't own a bicycle, the premise doesn't apply, but since he does, the conclusion holds.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** We aren't assuming Rishi is a bicycle owner; we're using the premise that all owners are within 5 km.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Conclusion):** After evaluating all aspects, Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{Yes}",
