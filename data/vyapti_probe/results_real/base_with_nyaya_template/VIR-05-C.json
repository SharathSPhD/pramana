Since the policy requires both conditions, no such students exist.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n   - **Fallacy of Intersection:** Assuming that if a student is in both sets, they are eligible.\n   - **Fallacy of Exclusion:** Assuming that only one condition is needed for eligibility.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\n   - After analyzing, the intersection of Set A and Set B is \\{q, r\\}.\n   - Therefore, students **q** and **r** are eligible for the athletics scholarship.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\{q, r\\}}",
