  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n### **Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step using the **Nyaya** methodology.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\n\nThe detective has some clues about the thief's entry:\n\n- **Clue 1:** The thief entered through either the window or the door.\n- **Clue 2:** If the thief entered through the window, muddy footprints would be on the windowsill.\n- **Clue 3:** There are no muddy footprints on the windowsill.\n- **Clue 4:** If the thief entered through the door, the lock would show scratch marks.\n- **Clue 5:** The lock shows scratch marks.\n\nThe detective is unsure whether the thief entered through the window or the door.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\n\nWe have direct evidence from the clues provided by the detective.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n\nLet's construct a syllogism using the five members:\n\n1. **Major Premise:** If the thief entered through the window, then muddy footprints would be on the windowsill.\n   - **Major Term:** Muddy footprints on the windowsill.\n   - **Minor Term:** Thief entered through the window.\n\n2. **Minor Premise:** There are no muddy footprints on the windowsill.\n   - **Major Term:** Muddy footprints on the windowsill.\n   - **Minor Term:** Thief entered through the window.\n\n3. **Middle Term:** Thief entered through the window or the door.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there are no muddy footprints on the windowsill, the thief did not enter through the window. Therefore, the thief must have entered through the door.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\n\nLet's consider counterarguments:\n\n- **If the thief entered through the window:** Then muddy footprints would be on the windowsill. But there are no muddy footprints, so this is impossible.\n- **If the thief entered through the door:** The lock would show scratch marks. And indeed, the lock shows scratch marks.\n\nThus, the thief must have entered through the door.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n\n- **Fallacy of Omission:** We considered all possibilities (window or door) and concluded based on the evidence.\n- **Fallacy of Conjunction:** We didn't assume the thief entered through both, which isn't possible.\n\nNo fallacies are present in our reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\n\nBased on the analysis, the thief entered through the **door**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The thief entered through the door.}}",
