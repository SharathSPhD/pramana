Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nWe have a doubt whether Species H has echolocation. The question is: Does Species H have echolocation?\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\nThe information provided is:\n- **Nocturnal species with echolocation:** A, B, C, F, G\n- **Nocturnal species without echolocation:** D\n- **Diurnal species without echolocation:** E\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\nWe can construct a syllogism to draw a conclusion.\n\n**Major Premise:** All nocturnal species with echolocation are likely to have echolocation.\n- **Nocturnal and echolocation \u2192 Echolocation**\n\n**Minor Premise:** Species H is a nocturnal species.\n- **H is nocturnal**\n\n**Conclusion:** Therefore, Species H is likely to have echolocation.\n- **H is nocturnal \u2192 H has echolocation**\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nWe consider the opposite: Suppose Species H does not have echolocation. However, since all other nocturnal species with echolocation do, and Species H is nocturnal, this scenario is inconsistent with the given data. Thus, Species H must have echolocation.\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nWe check for potential fallacies. The syllogism does not fall into any logical fallacy as it correctly follows the structure of premises and conclusion.\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nBased on the analysis, we can conclusively determine that Species H has echolocation.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, Species H has echolocation.}}",
