  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are analyzing the problem using the 6-phase **Nyaya** methodology.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n- **Question:** Is the temperature below 60\u00b0F if the heater is currently ON?\n- **Analysis:** The thermostat rule states that the heater turns on **if** the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F. This creates a doubt about whether the heater being ON necessarily means the temperature is below 60\u00b0F.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n- **Sources:** \n  - The thermostat rule: \"The heater turns on if the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F.\"\n  - The current state: The heater is ON.\n- **Conclusion:** The heater turning on is directly linked to the temperature being below 60\u00b0F.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n- **Major Premise:** The heater turns on **if** the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F.\n- **Minor Premise:** The heater is currently ON.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, the temperature is below 60\u00b0F.\n- **Analysis:** This syllogism logically connects the heater turning on to the temperature being below 60\u00b0F.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n- **Counterfactual:** If the heater were not ON, would the temperature be above 60\u00b0F?\n- **Analysis:** If the heater is not ON, it implies the temperature is not below 60\u00b0F, hence it is above 60\u00b0F.\n- **Conclusion:** This supports the original conclusion that the heater being ON indicates the temperature is below 60\u00b0F.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n- **Fallacies Checked:**\n  - **Denying the Antecedent:** Assuming that because the heater is ON, the temperature must be below 60\u00b0F.\n  - **Affirming the Consequent:** Assuming that because the temperature is above 60\u00b0F, the heater must be ON.\n- **Conclusion:** The original statement does not fall into these fallacies.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n- **Final Conclusion:** Based on the logical syllogism and the absence of fallacies, we can conclude that if the heater is currently ON, the temperature is indeed below 60\u00b0F.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the temperature is below 60\u00b0F.}}",
