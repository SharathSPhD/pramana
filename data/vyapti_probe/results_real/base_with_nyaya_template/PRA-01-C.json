The constraints are:\n\n1. **Amit** sits in position 1.\n2. **Bela** sits immediately to the right of **Amit**.\n3. **Charu** sits in position 5.\n4. **Ela** does **not** sit in position 3.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n#### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nWe need to determine the seating arrangement based on the given constraints.\n\n#### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\nThe information provided is the only source of knowledge for this problem.\n\n#### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\nLet's analyze the constraints step by step.\n\n- **Amit** is fixed in position 1.\n- **Bela** must be in position 2 (immediately to the right of **Amit**).\n- **Charu** is fixed in position 5.\n- **Ela** cannot be in position 3.\n\n#### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nLet's consider if any constraints could be misinterpreted or if there's a possibility of multiple solutions.\n\n- Suppose **Ela** is in position 3. But the constraint says she cannot be there. So, **Ela** must be in another position.\n- The remaining positions are 2, 3, and 4. However, position 2 is already occupied by **Bela**, and position 3 is restricted for **Ela**. Therefore, **Ela** must be in position 4.\n\n#### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nWe need to ensure that our reasoning doesn't fall into any logical errors.\n\n- **Amit** in 1, **Bela** in 2, **Charu** in 5, and **Ela** in 4 satisfy all constraints.\n- **Dev** would then be in position 3, which is allowed since there's no restriction on **Dev**.\n\n#### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nAfter verifying all constraints and ensuring no contradictions, we can conclude the seating arrangement.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nEla sits in position **4**.",
