The claim is:  \n*\"Every student who is in both Philosophy and Mathematics is also enrolled in the Logic course.\"*\n\nLet's analyze this using the 6-phase **Nyaya methodology**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \nWe have a doubt whether every student enrolled in both Philosophy (P) and Mathematics (M) is also enrolled in Logic (L). To resolve this, we need to examine the data provided.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \nThe data provided is:\n- **Set P (Philosophy students):** {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Riya}\n- **Set M (Mathematics students):** {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Sana}\n- **Set L (Logic course enrollees):** {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Qasim, Tara}\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \nWe need to construct a syllogism to test the advisor's claim.  \n- **Major premise:** All students in set P are in set M.  \n- **Minor premise:** All students in set M are in set L.  \n- **Conclusion:** All students in set P are in set L.\n\nHowever, this syllogism does not directly address the advisor's claim. Instead, we should focus on the intersection of P and M and verify if all these students are in L.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \nLet's consider the counterfactual:  \n*\"There exists a student who is in both P and M but not in L.\"*  \nIf such a student exists, the advisor's claim is false.\n\nFrom the data:\n- The intersection of P and M is {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya}.  \n- All these students are also in L (as L includes Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya).  \n- Sana is only in M, not in P.\n\nThus, no student is in both P and M but not in L. Therefore, the counterfactual is false.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \nWe need to check for any fallacies in the reasoning.  \n- **Fallacy of Omission:** Have we missed any student in the intersection of P and M?  \n  - No, the intersection is accurately identified as {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya}.  \n- **Fallacy of Conjunction:** Assuming that being in both P and M automatically enrolls one in L.  \n  - This assumption is valid based on the data provided.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \nSince no counterexamples exist in the data, the advisor's claim holds true.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
