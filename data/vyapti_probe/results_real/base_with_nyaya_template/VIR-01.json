Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nWe are given that:\n- **Hypothesis (If-p)**: If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.\n- **Fact (Not-p)**: Student X has NOT completed all homework assignments.\n\nThe question is: What can we conclude about Student X's final exam result?\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\nThe information provided is sufficient to analyze the situation. There are no additional sources of knowledge needed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nA syllogism has the following structure:\n- **Major Premise**: If A, then B.\n- **Minor Premise**: A student is a student.\n- **Conclusion**: Therefore, B.\n\nIn our case:\n- **Major Premise**: If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments. (If-p)\n- **Minor Premise**: Student X is a student. (A student is a student)\n- **Conclusion**: Therefore, Student X has completed all homework assignments. (B)\n\nHowever, we know that Student X has **NOT** completed all homework assignments. This contradicts the conclusion derived from the syllogism.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the given rule:\n- Original statement: If A (passes final exam), then B (completes homework).\n- Contrapositive: If not B (does not complete homework), then not A (does not pass final exam).\n\nGiven that Student X has **not completed** all homework assignments (not B), according to the contrapositive, Student X **should not pass** the final exam (not A).\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nWe need to check if there are any logical fallacies in our reasoning:\n- **Affirming the Contrary**: We correctly applied the contrapositive.\n- **Denying the Antecedent**: This fallacy occurs when we conclude not A based on not B. However, in this case, the contrapositive is correctly applied, so there is no fallacy.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nAfter analyzing the syllogism and applying counterfactual reasoning, we conclude that:\n- **Student X has NOT passed the final exam.**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{Student X has NOT passed the final exam.}}",
