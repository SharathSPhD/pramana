Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \nWe have a doubt whether the backup system activated or not based on the server's load and network status.\n\n**Doubt:**  \nIs the backup system activated if the server is overloaded **OR** the network is down?\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \nWe rely on the administrator's statement as the source of knowledge.\n\n**Administrator's Statement:**  \n\"If the server is overloaded **OR** the network is down, the backup system activates.\"\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \nLet's break down the syllogism:\n\n- **Major Premise:** If the server is overloaded **OR** the network is down, the backup system activates.\n- **Minor Premise:** The server is not overloaded, and the network is functioning.\n- **Conclusion:** Therefore, the backup system does **NOT** activate.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \nLet's consider counterfactuals to test the validity of the conclusion.\n\n- **Counterfactual 1:** Suppose the server is overloaded.  \n  - Then, according to the premise, the backup system should activate.  \n  - This aligns with the premise.\n\n- **Counterfactual 2:** Suppose the network is down.  \n  - Then, according to the premise, the backup system should activate.  \n  - This also aligns with the premise.\n\n- **Counterfactual 3:** Suppose neither the server is overloaded nor the network is down.  \n  - Then, according to the premise, the backup system should **not** activate.  \n  - This is consistent with our observation.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \nCheck for any logical fallacies in the reasoning.\n\n- **Fallacy of the Conjunction:** The statement uses \"OR,\" which is a logical disjunction.  \n  - If either condition is true, the backup system activates.  \n  - If both are false, the backup system does not activate.  \n- **No fallacies detected in this reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n#### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \nBased on the analysis, we can conclusively determine:\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIf the server is **not** overloaded **AND** the network is functioning, the backup system does **NOT** activate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{The backup system does NOT activate because neither the server is overloaded nor the network is down.}}",
