  "raw_response": "</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe will analyze the problem using the **6-phase Nyaya methodology**:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n- **Question:** Is Object Q classified as Type-X?\n- **Doubt:** The classification depends on whether Object Q meets the criteria for Type-X.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n- **Rule 1:** An object is classified as Type-X if it has Feature-P.\n- **Rule 2:** Feature-P is defined as having a surface temperature above 1000\u00b0C.\n- **Source of Knowledge:** The classification rules are provided as given.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nWe need to construct a syllogism to determine the classification.\n\n- **Major Premise:** All Type-X objects have Feature-P.\n  - **Major Term:** Type-X\n  - **Middle Term:** Feature-P\n  - **Minor Term:** Objects\n  - **Relation:** If something is Type-X, then it has Feature-P.\n\n- **Minor Premise:** Object Q has a surface temperature of 1200\u00b0C.\n  - **Major Term:** Object Q\n  - **Minor Term:** Temperature\n  - **Relation:** Object Q has a surface temperature of 1200\u00b0C.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Since Object Q has Feature-P (surface temperature above 1000\u00b0C), it is classified as Type-X.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n- **Counterfactual:** What if Object Q's temperature was below 1000\u00b0C?\n  - If Object Q's temperature was below 1000\u00b0C, it would not have Feature-P, and thus would not be classified as Type-X.\n- **Conclusion:** The classification holds only if Object Q's temperature is above 1000\u00b0C.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n- **Fallacy Identification:** There are no known fallacies in the given reasoning.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is free from logical errors.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n- **Final Ascertainment:** Based on the syllogism and the given premises, Object Q is classified as Type-X.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, Object Q is classified as Type-X.}}",
