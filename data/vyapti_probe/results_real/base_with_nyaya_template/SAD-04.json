Let me break it down step by step using the Nyaya methodology.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the database administrator has a rule: \"User X is authorized if and only if User X appears in the authorized users list.\" And it also says that the authorized users list contains exactly those users who are authorized. So, the list is both the definition and the only source of authorized users.\n\nUser Y is requesting access, and we need to determine if they're authorized. Let's start with the first phase, Samshaya, which is about identifying the doubt or question. The question here is straightforward: Is User Y authorized?\n\nNext, Pramana, which deals with sources of knowledge. The rule mentions that the authorized users list is the source. So, we need to check if User Y is in that list. But wait, the problem doesn't provide any specific information about whether User Y is on the list or not. It just says that the list contains exactly those who are authorized. So, without knowing if Y is on the list, we can't directly say if they're authorized. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.\n\nMoving on to Pancha Avayava, the five-member syllogism. Let me try to structure this. The rule can be phrased as: If a user is in the authorized list, then they are authorized. And conversely, if a user is authorized, they are in the list. So it's a biconditional statement. Now, applying this to User Y, we need to see if they fit either part.\n\nIn the first part, if Y is in the list, then they're authorized. But since we don't know if Y is in the list, we can't confirm authorization based on that. The second part says if Y is authorized, they must be in the list. But again, without knowing their authorization status, we can't apply this part either.\n\nTarka, or counterfactual reasoning, might help here. Let's consider if User Y is authorized. If they are, then according to the rule, they must be in the list. But if they aren't in the list, they can't be authorized. So, the rule seems to be a two-way implication. But without knowing either their presence in the list or their authorization status, we can't make a definitive conclusion.\n\nNow, Hetvabhasa, checking for fallacies. One possible fallacy here is assuming that the list is exhaustive. If the list is supposed to contain exactly the authorized users, then any user not on the list isn't authorized. But the problem doesn't state that the list is complete; it just says it contains exactly those who are authorized. So, maybe there are other ways to be authorized besides being on the list? Wait, no, the rule says \"if and only if,\" which implies that being on the list is both necessary and sufficient. So, the list is exhaustive in the sense that all authorized users are on it, and only those on it are authorized. Therefore, if User Y isn't on the list, they can't be authorized.\n\nBut again, since we don't know if Y is on the list, we can't say for sure. Unless there's a way to infer their presence without explicit information. Maybe the rule implies that the list is the only way to be authorized, so if Y is requesting access, they must be on the list to be authorized.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about how the list is managed or how Y's request is processed. It just gives the rule. So, perhaps the rule is that authorization is solely based on being in the list, and if Y is requesting, they must be in the list to be authorized. Therefore, unless Y is explicitly added to the list, they aren't authorized.\n\nPutting it all together, without specific information about Y's presence in the list, we can't confirm authorization. But based on the rule, if Y is authorized, they must be on the list. So, if Y is requesting, they must be on the list to be authorized. Therefore, unless the administrator has added Y to the list, they aren't authorized.\n\nI think the key here is that the rule is a biconditional, meaning that authorization is entirely dependent on being in the list. So, if Y is authorized, they must be in the list, and if they're in the list, they're authorized. Since the problem doesn't say Y is in the list, we can't assume they are. Therefore, the answer would be that User Y is not authorized unless they are explicitly added to the list.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about Y's request beyond the rule. So, without knowing if Y is on the list, we can't say for sure. However, the rule states that the list contains exactly those who are authorized. So, if Y is authorized, they must be on the list. But if Y isn't on the list, they can't be authorized. Therefore, unless the administrator has added Y to the list, Y isn't authorized.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any action the administrator has taken regarding Y's request. So, perhaps the answer is that we don't have enough information to determine if Y is authorized. However, considering the rule strictly, the only way Y can be authorized is if they are on the list. Since we don't know if they are, we can't say they're authorized.\n\nWait, but the question is asking if Y is authorized based on the rule. The rule says that being on the list is the only way to be authorized. So, unless Y is on the list, they aren't authorized. Therefore, the answer is no, Y isn't authorized unless they are on the list.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any information about Y being on the list. So, perhaps the answer is that we can't determine for sure, but based on the rule, Y isn't authorized unless they are on the list.\n\nWait, but the rule is a definition. So, the list is the source of authorization. Therefore, if Y is on the list, they are authorized. If they aren't, they aren't. Since we don't know if Y is on the list, we can't say for sure. Therefore, the answer is that we don't have enough information to determine if Y is authorized.\n\nBut the question is asking, \"Is User Y authorized?\" So, perhaps the answer is no, because the rule requires them to be on the list, and without that, they aren't authorized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule implies that the list is the only way to be authorized, so if Y is requesting, they must be on the list. Therefore, unless they are, they aren't authorized.\n\nI think the key point is that the rule is a biconditional: X is authorized iff X is on the list. Therefore, for any user, including Y, they are authorized only if they are on the list. Since we don't know if Y is on the list, we can't say they're authorized.\n\nSo, the final answer is that User Y is not authorized unless they are explicitly listed in the authorized users list.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer:**\nUser Y is not authorized unless they are explicitly listed in the authorized users list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** The question is whether User Y is authorized.\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The only source is the authorized users list, which contains exactly those who are authorized.\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** The rule is a biconditional: A user is authorized if and only if they are on the list.\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If Y is authorized, they must be on the list. If they aren't on the list, they aren't authorized.\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** The rule implies the list is exhaustive for authorization.\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** Without Y being on the list, they aren't authorized.\n\n**Answer:** User Y is not authorized unless they are on the authorized users list.",
