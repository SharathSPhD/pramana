It returns an analysis using the Nyaya methodology, concluding that Object X is indeed Concept A.\n```\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Object X is Concept A based on the definitions given. Let me break this down step by step using the Nyaya methodology.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions. Concept A is defined as anything that has property B. Property B is having a molecular weight greater than 500 daltons. So, if something has property B, it's considered Concept A.\n\nObject X has a molecular weight of 750 daltons. That's definitely more than 500, so it seems like it should have property B. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nStarting with Samshaya, which is about raising doubts. The question is: Is Object X Concept A? I think it is, but I need to verify. So, the doubt here is whether the molecular weight directly translates to having property B, which in turn makes it Concept A.\n\nNext, Pramana is about sources of knowledge. The source here is the textbook definition. It clearly states that property B is a molecular weight greater than 500. So, the textbook is our primary source.\n\nPancha Avayava is the five-member syllogism. Let me structure this. The major premise is \"Concept A is defined as anything that has property B.\" The minor premise is \"Object X has property B.\" So, combining these, the conclusion should be \"Object X is Concept A.\" That makes sense logically.\n\nNow, Tarka is counterfactual reasoning. Suppose Object X didn't have property B, would it still be Concept A? No, because the definition of Concept A specifically requires property B. So, if it didn't have it, it wouldn't be Concept A. But since it does, the counterfactual doesn't apply here.\n\nHetvabhasa is checking for fallacies. Did I make any mistake in reasoning? I don't think so. The definitions are straightforward, and Object X meets the criteria for property B. So, no fallacies detected.\n\nFinally, Nirnaya is the ascertainment. After all this analysis, I conclude that Object X does have property B and therefore is Concept A.\n\nI think that covers all the steps. I'm confident in this conclusion because each part of the methodology supports it.\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):** The question is whether Object X is Concept A. The doubt is whether having a molecular weight of 750 daltons satisfies the definition of property B.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The textbook defines property B as a molecular weight greater than 500. This is our source of knowledge.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n   - Major Premise: Concept A is defined as having property B.\n   - Minor Premise: Object X has property B (750 > 500).\n   - Conclusion: Therefore, Object X is Concept A.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If Object X didn't have property B, it wouldn't be Concept A. Since it does, the counterfactual doesn't change the conclusion.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** No fallacies were committed. The reasoning is logical and follows the given definitions.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** After analysis, Object X is confirmed to be Concept A because it meets the criteria for property B.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Object X has property B and is therefore Concept A.",
