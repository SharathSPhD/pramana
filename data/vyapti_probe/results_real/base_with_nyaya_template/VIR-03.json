Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\n**Question:** Can we conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test?\n\n**Analysis:** The given statement is a conditional one: \"If a student scores above 90, they receive a scholarship.\" Student Y received a scholarship, so we have the conditional and the consequence. However, we don't know if Student Y scored above 90 or if there were other reasons for the scholarship.\n\n**Answer:** There is a doubt because we don't know Student Y's test score.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n**Question:** What are the sources of knowledge relevant to this problem?\n\n**Answer:** The information provided is a conditional statement and the fact that Student Y received a scholarship.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n**Question:** Applying the syllogism structure to the problem.\n\n**Syllogism Structure:**\n1. All students who scored above 90 received a scholarship.\n2. Student Y received a scholarship.\n3. Therefore, Student Y scored above 90.\n\n**Answer:** The syllogism is valid, but we need additional information about Student Y's score.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Question:** Considering counterfactuals.\n\n**Counterfactual:** If Student Y received a scholarship, could they have scored 90 or below?\n\n**Analysis:** The conditional statement doesn't provide information about students who scored 90 or below. Therefore, Student Y could have scored above 90, but it's not certain.\n\n**Answer:** It's possible, but not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n**Question:** Identifying any fallacies in the reasoning.\n\n**Fallacy:** Assuming that the receipt of a scholarship only occurs for scores above 90.\n\n**Analysis:** The given statement doesn't specify if there are other criteria for scholarships. Therefore, the conclusion might be a fallacy.\n\n**Answer:** The conclusion may be a fallacy due to unknown criteria.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n**Question:** Determining the final conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Student Y scored above 90. Additional evidence about Student Y's test score is required.\n\n**Final Answer:** No, we cannot validly conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test based on the given information.",
