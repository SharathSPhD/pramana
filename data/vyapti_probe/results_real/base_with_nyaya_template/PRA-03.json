  "raw_response": "</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step using the **6-phase Nyaya methodology**:\n\n### **1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nWe are given the following premises:\n- **X** is true.\n- **Y** is true.\n- **Z** is false.\n\nThe question is: What is the value of **Q**?\n\n### **2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\nWe need to understand the rules that determine **Q**:\n1. **If X is true AND Y is true, then Q is true.**\n2. **If X is true AND Y is false, then Q is false.**\n3. **Z is true OR Z is false.**\n4. **If Y is true AND X is false, then Q is false.**\n\n### **3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nLet's construct a syllogism to determine **Q**.\n\n**Premise 1:** X is true AND Y is true \u2192 Q is true.\n**Premise 2:** X is true AND Y is false \u2192 Q is false.\n**Premise 3:** Z is true OR Z is false.\n**Premise 4:** Y is true AND X is false \u2192 Q is false.\n\nSince we know that **X** is true and **Y** is true, let's apply **Premise 1**:\n- **X** is true AND **Y** is true \u2192 **Q** is true.\n\n### **4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nLet's consider if any of the premises could be false or if there are any contradictions.\n\n- **Premise 1** is directly applicable since **X** and **Y** are both true.\n- **Premise 2** is not applicable because **Y** is true, not false.\n- **Premise 3** is a tautology (always true) since **Z** is either true or false.\n- **Premise 4** is not applicable because **X** is true, not false.\n\nThere are no contradictions or false premises in the given information.\n\n### **5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nLet's check for any fallacies in the syllogism.\n\n- **Premise 1** is a straightforward conditional statement.\n- **Premise 2** is also a straightforward conditional statement.\n- **Premise 3** is a tautology and doesn't introduce any fallacy.\n- **Premise 4** is similarly straightforward.\n\nThere are no fallacies in the premises.\n\n### **6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclusively determine the value of **Q**.\n\n**Given that X is true and Y is true**, according to **Premise 1**, **Q** must be **true**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Q \\text{ is true}}",
