  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Nyaya Analysis:\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\n*What is the question?*\nIs User Y authorized?\n\n*What do we need to prove?*\nWe need to determine whether User Y is authorized based on the given access control rule.\n\n*What are the possibilities?*\n1. User Y is authorized.\n2. User Y is not authorized.\n\n*What is the reason for doubt?*\nThe rule states that a user is authorized if and only if they appear in the authorized users list. Since the list defines who is authorized, we need to verify if User Y is included.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\n*What is the source of knowledge?*\nThe rule provided by the database administrator.\n\n*What is the content of the rule?*\nUser X is authorized \u21e8 User X is in the authorized users list, and vice versa.\n\n*What is the justification?*\nThe rule establishes a bi-conditional relationship between authorization and inclusion in the list.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\n*What is the syllogism?*\nIf X is authorized \u21e8 X is in the list, and X is in the list \u21e8 X is authorized.\n\n*What are the premises?*\n1. If X is authorized, then X is in the list.\n2. If X is in the list, then X is authorized.\n\n*What is the conclusion?*\nTherefore, X is authorized \u21e8 X is in the list, and vice versa.\n\n*What is the connection?*\nThe rule forms a necessary and sufficient condition for authorization.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\n*What is the counterfactual?*\nSuppose User Y is authorized but is not in the list.\n\n*What is the result?*\nThis contradicts the rule, which states that authorization requires inclusion in the list.\n\n*What is the conclusion?*\nTherefore, if User Y is authorized, they must be in the list.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n*What is the fallacy?*\nDenying the antecedent (assuming the consequent is false when the antecedent is true).\n\n*What is the reasoning?*\nIf the rule is followed, a user is authorized only if they are in the list. If they are not in the list, they are not authorized.\n\n*What is the test?*\nCheck if the rule is followed consistently.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\n*What is the conclusion?*\nUser Y is authorized if and only if they appear in the authorized users list.\n\n*What is the reasoning?*\nThe rule establishes a bi-conditional relationship, meaning inclusion in the list is both necessary and sufficient for authorization.\n\n*What is the final answer?*\nYes, User Y is authorized if and only if they are in the list. Since the list defines authorization, we must check if User Y is included.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Yes, User Y is authorized if and only if User Y appears in the authorized users list.**",
