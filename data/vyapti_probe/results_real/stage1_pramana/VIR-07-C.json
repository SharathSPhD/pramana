We observe the server is overloaded, satisfying one part of the OR condition.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**: We know the server is overloaded, the network is up, and the backup system activates when either condition is met.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**: This structure logically deduces that the backup system activates because the server is overloaded, regardless of the network status.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**: If the backup system didn't activate, it would contradict the system's design, showing that our conclusion is valid.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**: We verify that no fallacies affect our reasoning, ensuring our knowledge about the backup system is accurate and specific.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**: The backup system must activate because the server is overloaded, satisfying the OR condition stated by the administrator.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe backup system activates.",
