What is the truth table for the Boolean expression (P AND Q) OR R?\n2. How do logical operators work in Boolean algebra?\n3. What is the value of each component (P AND Q) and R when given specific truth values?\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. The Boolean expression is a combination of AND and OR operations. The AND operator returns true only if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns false. The OR operator returns true if at least one operand is true; otherwise, it returns false.\n2. The expression (P AND Q) OR R can be evaluated by first computing P AND Q, then OR-ing the result with R.\n3. Given P = true, Q = false, R = true, we can substitute these values into the expression step by step.\n\n**Resolving Doubts:**\n1. Construct the truth table for (P AND Q) OR R:\n   - P | Q | R | P AND Q | (P AND Q) OR R\n   - T | T | T |   T    |   T\n   - T | T | F |   T    |   T\n   - T | F | T |   F    |   T\n   - T | F | F |   F    |   F\n   - F | T | T |   F    |   T\n   - F | T | F |   F    |   F\n   - F | F | T |   F    |   T\n   - F | F | F |   F    |   F\n2. The expression (P AND Q) OR R evaluates to true in all cases except when P is false, Q is false, and R is false.\n3. Given P = true, Q = false, R = true, substitute into the expression:\n   - P AND Q = true AND false = false\n   - (P AND Q) OR R = false OR true = true\n\n**Answer to Samshaya:** OUT is true because (P AND Q) evaluates to false, and OR-ing with R (true) results in true.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n**Sources:**\n1. Boolean truth tables\n2. Logical operator definitions\n3. Given values: P = true, Q = false, R = true\n\n**Pratyaksha (Perception):** Direct knowledge of the truth values and logical operations.\n\n**Anumana (Inference):** From the truth table and logical definitions, we infer that (P AND Q) OR R evaluates to true when P is true, Q is false, and R is true.\n\n**Pratyaksha Sama\u00f1a:** The expression (P AND Q) OR R is true for the given truth values.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n**Syllogism Structure:**\n1. **Pratyaksha (Thesis):** OUT is true when P is true, Q is false, R is true.\n2. **Hetu (Reason):** Because (P AND Q) OR R evaluates to true in this scenario.\n3. **Udaharana (Comparison):** Compare with all possible truth combinations in the truth table.\n4. **Prasanga (Application):** Apply the logical operators step by step.\n5. **Nigamana (Conclusion):** OUT is true.\n\n**Syllogism:**\n1. **Thesis (Pratyaksha):** OUT is true.\n2. **Reason (Hetu):** (P AND Q) OR R evaluates to true.\n3. **Comparison (Udaharana):** The truth table confirms this.\n4. **Application (Prasanga):** Substituting the given values.\n5. **Conclusion (Nigamana):** OUT is true.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Counterfactual Analysis:**\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Suppose OUT is false when P is true, Q is false, R is true.\n2. **Check consistency:** This assumption leads to a contradiction because (P AND Q) OR R must be true in this scenario.\n3. **Conclude:** Therefore, our original assertion that OUT is true must be correct.\n\n**Tarka Syllogism:**\n1. **Hypothesis (Thesis):** OUT is true.\n2. **Counterfactual (Counter-hypothesis):** Suppose OUT is false.\n3. **Consequence (Prayatna):** This leads to a contradiction because (P AND Q) OR R is true.\n4. **Conclusion (Nigamana):** Therefore, OUT must be true.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n**Fallacy Identification:**\n1. **Equivalence Fallacy:** Checking for logical equivalences to ensure no fallacies.\n2. **Affirming the Distributive:** Ensuring no fallacies in operator application.\n3. **Denying the Distributive:** Ensuring no fallacies in operator application.\n\n**Fallacy Check:**\n1. The expression (P AND Q) OR R is logically sound.\n2. Substituting truth values follows logical operator precedence.\n3. No fallacies in operator application.\n\n**Verification:**\n1. The expression is a standard Boolean combination.\n2. Logical operator precedence is respected.\n3. No fallacies are present in the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n**Final Ascertainment:**\n1. **Pratyaksha (Perception):** Direct evaluation of the expression with given truth values yields true.\n2. **Anumana (Inference):** The logical structure and truth table confirm the result.\n3. **Samprayog (Combination):** All evidence and reasoning align to conclude OUT is true.\n\n**Final Answer:** OUT is true.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 7: Answer to Questions\n1. **Value of OUT:** true\n2. **Change in R:** If R is changed to false, (P AND Q) OR R becomes (true AND false) OR false = false OR false = false. Therefore, OUT changes from true to false.",
