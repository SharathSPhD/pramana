We need to determine if the alarm sounds exclusively when sensor A is triggered.\n\n**Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**  \nThe system log provides specific events:\n- Event 1: A and B triggered \u2192 Alarm sounds\n- Event 2: A and C triggered \u2192 Alarm sounds\n- Event 3: A and D triggered \u2192 Alarm sounds\n- Event 4: A, B, and C triggered \u2192 Alarm sounds\n- Event 5: B, C, and A not triggered \u2192 Alarm does not sound\n\n**Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**  \n1. **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception): The log directly reports sensor states and alarm outcomes.\n2. **Anumana** (Inference): From the log, we infer that the alarm sounds whenever A is triggered.\n3. **Drishti** (Testimony): The manual confirms that the alarm sounds if and only if A is triggered.\n4. **Sama** (Comparison): All events follow the same rule: alarm sounds when A is triggered.\n5. **Pratiphana** (Establishment): The claim is consistent across all events.\n\n**Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**  \nAssume the claim is false. If A is not triggered, the alarm should not sound. However, Event 5 contradicts this, showing that when A is not triggered, the alarm does not sound. Thus, the claim holds.\n\n**Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**  \nNo fallacies are present in the reasoning.\n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**  \nThe claim \"The alarm sounds whenever sensor A is triggered\" is valid based on the system log and manual confirmation.",
