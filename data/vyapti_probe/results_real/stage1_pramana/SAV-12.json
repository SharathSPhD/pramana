Patient 4 is the only treated patient who did not recover. This suggests that Treatment T works for all patients who received it. The representative's claim is valid because all treated patients in the study recovered, except for Patient 4, who did not receive Treatment T. Therefore, Treatment T guarantees recovery for patients with Condition X who are treated.",
