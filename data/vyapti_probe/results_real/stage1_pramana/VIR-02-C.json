Test Case 1:\n   - Test-A passes: True\n   - Test-B passes: True\n   - Expected: False (Not rejected)\n   - Output: False\n\n2. Test Case 2:\n   - Test-A passes: False\n   - Test-B passes: True\n   - Expected: True (Rejected)\n   - Output: True\n\n3. Test Case 3:\n   - Test-A passes: True\n   - Test-B passes: False\n   - Expected: True (Rejected)\n   - Output: True\n\n4. Test Case 4:\n   - Test-A passes: False\n   - Test-B passes: False\n   - Expected: True (Rejected)\n   - Output: True\n\n5. Test Case 5:\n   - Test-A passes: True\n   - Test-B passes: True\n   - Expected: False (Not rejected)\n   - Output: False\n\n6. Test Case 6:\n   - Test-A passes: False\n   - Test-B passes: False\n   - Expected: True (Rejected)\n   - Output: True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe function `is_product_rejected` checks whether the product is rejected based on the logical condition provided. It returns `True` if either Test-A fails or Test-B fails (or both), and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem's requirement that the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that both tests pass. The test cases verify the function's correctness across all possible combinations of test outcomes.",
