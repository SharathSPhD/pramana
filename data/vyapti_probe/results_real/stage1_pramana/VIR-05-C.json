This requires determining the intersection of the two sets.\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**: The information provided directly gives us the membership of each set.\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**: We use the syllogism to determine the intersection.\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**: We consider what happens if a student is not in both sets and conclude they are not eligible.\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**: We ensure our reasoning avoids circular reasoning and other fallacies.\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**: Through systematic analysis, we conclude the eligible students are q and r.\n\nThe final answer is the intersection of Set A and Set B, which are students q and r.\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe students eligible for the athletics scholarship are \\boxed{\\{q, r\\}}.\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n1. **Identify the Sets**: \n   - Set A (Sports Players) = {p, q, r, s, t}\n   - Set B (Honor Roll Students) = {q, r, u, v}\n\n2. **Understand the Policy**:\n   - Students must be in **both** Set A and Set B to be eligible.\n\n3. **Find the Intersection**:\n   - The intersection of Set A and Set B contains students who are in both sets.\n   - Comparing the two sets: q and r are common members.\n\n4. **List the Eligible Students**:\n   - The eligible students are q and r.\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure no other students are mistakenly included by checking each member of the intersection against both sets.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The students eligible for the athletics scholarship are q and r.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    set_a = {'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't'}\n    set_b = {'q', 'r', 'u', 'v'}\n    eligible = set_a & set_b\n    return list(eligible)\n```",
