  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Nyaya Solution:\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nThe question raises a doubt about whether User A should be granted access on June 1. The system must determine if the access is still active.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\nThe system relies on the log entries:\n- Jan 1: Grant\n- Mar 15: Revocation\n- Jun 1: Attempt\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n**Pratijna (Thesis):** User A should be granted access on June 1.\n**Hetu (Reason):** The access was granted on Jan 1 and not revoked by Mar 15.\n**Udaharana (Example):** If access is granted and not revoked, it remains valid.\n**Upanaya (Application):** Apply to User A and Server X.\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, access should be granted.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nIf access were revoked, the system would deny access. Since revocation is not recorded, access remains valid.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nNo fallacies are present. The reasoning follows logical principles.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nBased on the evidence, User A should be granted access on June 1.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nYes, the system should grant User A access to Server X on June 1.",
