How can we resolve it?*  \nWe are uncertain whether Employee Z has completed the safety training. The policy states that without training, employees are not permitted to enter the restricted zone. Since Employee Z is permitted and is inside the restricted zone, we must determine if this implies they have completed the training.\n\n**Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**  \n*What are the sources of knowledge for this problem? What are the premises?*  \nThe sources of knowledge are:  \n1. The policy document stating the rule.  \n2. The fact that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.  \n3. The contrapositive of the rule: \"If permitted, then training has been completed.\"  \n4. The fact that Employee Z is currently inside the restricted zone.  \n\n**Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**  \n*What is the syllogism structure? What are the premises and conclusion?*  \nThe syllogism follows the structure:  \n1. **Pratijna** (Thesis): \"No employee who has not completed the safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\"  \n2. **Heti** (Reason): \"If an employee is permitted to enter the restricted zone, then they must have completed the safety training.\"  \n3. **Udaharana** (Example): \"Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\"  \n4. **Prasanga** (Application): \"Therefore, Employee Z has completed the safety training.\"  \n5. **Nigamana** (Conclusion): \"Employee Z has completed the safety training.\"  \n\n**Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**  \n*What counterfactuals can we test? What conclusions can we draw?*  \n1. **Counterfactual 1**: Suppose Employee Z has not completed the safety training.  \n   - Then, according to the policy, they would not be permitted to enter the restricted zone.  \n   - This contradicts the fact that Employee Z is permitted.  \n   - Therefore, our assumption is false, and Employee Z must have completed the training.  \n\n2. **Counterfactual 2**: Suppose Employee Z has completed the safety training.  \n   - This does not contradict any information provided.  \n   - Therefore, this scenario is consistent with the premises.  \n\n**Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**  \n*Which fallacies are present? How can we identify them?*  \nWe analyze the premises for fallacies:  \n1. **Akampaniya** (No universal expansion): The policy applies to all employees, and we correctly apply it to Employee Z.  \n2. **Savyabhichara** (No relabeling fallacy): The terms are used consistently throughout the reasoning.  \n3. **Viruddhakala** (No temporal fallacy): The policy is timeless, and the present state of Employee Z is considered.  \n4. **Heterotropi** (No circular reasoning): The contrapositive is derived directly from the original statement, not assumed independently.  \n5. **Dharmabhuta** (No essentialism fallacy): We correctly apply the rule to the specific case without assuming essential properties.  \n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**  \n*What is the final conclusion? How is it supported?*  \nBased on the contrapositive of the policy and the fact that Employee Z is permitted, we conclude that Employee Z has completed the safety training. This conclusion is supported by the logical structure of the syllogism and the consistency with the premises.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, Employee Z has completed the safety training.}}",
