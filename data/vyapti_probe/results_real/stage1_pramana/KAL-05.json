  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Nyaya Analysis:\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nWhat is the question? When was Building Z constructed and what are its ceiling dimensions? The inspector needs to determine if the building meets the current code.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\n- Original Code (2015): Minimum ceiling height for residential buildings is 8 feet.\n- Amendment (2022): After 2020, minimum ceiling height is 9 feet. Pre-2020 buildings are grandfathered under the original code.\n- Building Z: Constructed in 2023, 8.5-foot ceilings.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n**Pratijna (Thesis):** Building Z complies with the current building code.\n**Heti (Reason):** It was constructed after 2020 and meets the minimum ceiling height.\n**Udaharana (Example):** Any post-2020 building with at least 9 feet ceilings complies.\n**Upanaya (Application):** Building Z has 8.5 feet ceilings, which is above 8 feet but below 9 feet.\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, it complies because it meets the 2022 amendment's requirement.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\nIf Building Z had been constructed before 2020, it would have been grandfathered under the original code. But it was built in 2023, so the amendment applies.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\nNo fallacies detected. The reasoning follows logically without circularity or bias.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nBuilding Z complies with the current building code because it was constructed after 2020 and has a ceiling height meeting the 2022 amendment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Building Z complies with the current building code.**",
