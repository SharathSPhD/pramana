Student Y received a scholarship. Therefore, Student Y scored above 90.\n\n**Udaharana (Comparison):** In cases where a cause is present and its effect is observed, the cause must be present. (Example: Fire causes smoke; Smoke observed \u2192 Fire present.)\n\n**Tarka (Counterfactual):** Suppose Student Y did not score above 90. Then, they would not have received a scholarship. But we know they did receive one. Therefore, Student Y must have scored above 90.\n\n**Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** The argument does not commit any logical fallacy. The conclusion follows directly from the premises.\n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** The conclusion is valid and certain.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Pratijna (Thesis):** Can we validly conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test?\n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** Yes, we can validly conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test. The conclusion is certain and definitive.",
