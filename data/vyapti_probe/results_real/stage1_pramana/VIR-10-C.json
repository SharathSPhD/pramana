It begins with Samshaya (Doubt Analysis) by identifying the question and reasons for doubt. Then, it proceeds through Pramana (Sources of Knowledge), Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism), Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning), Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check), and finally Nirnaya (Ascertainment) to reach a definitive conclusion. The final answer is printed as the return value.",
