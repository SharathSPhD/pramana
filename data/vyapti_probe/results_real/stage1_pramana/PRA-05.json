  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Nyaya Inference Process:\n\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \n   We are to determine which lab Ravi works in. The information provided is about the locations and beverages of four researchers, but Ravi's lab assignment is not directly stated. This creates a doubt that needs to be resolved.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \n   The information is provided through direct statements:  \n   - Priya works in Lab-North.  \n   - Qadir works in Lab-South.  \n   - Ravi drinks coffee.  \n   - Sita works in Lab-North.  \n   - Priya drinks tea.  \n   These are the only facts we consider.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \n   We construct a syllogism to reason about Ravi's lab assignment.  \n   **Pratijna (Thesis):** Ravi works in Lab-North or Lab-South.  \n   **Hetu (Reason):** Priya works in Lab-North, Sita works in Lab-North, Qadir works in Lab-South. Since there are two labs and four researchers, and two are assigned to Lab-North (Priya and Sita), the remaining two (Ravi and Qadir) must be assigned to Lab-South.  \n   **Udaharana (Example):** If two labs exist and four researchers are assigned with two in each lab, then each additional researcher must be assigned to the remaining lab.  \n   **Prasanga (Application):** Applying this rule, Ravi must work in Lab-South.  \n   **Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, Ravi works in Lab-South.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \n   Suppose Ravi worked in Lab-North. Then, since Priya and Sita are already in Lab-North, there would be three researchers in Lab-North, which is impossible as there are only two labs and four researchers. This contradiction implies that Ravi cannot work in Lab-North. Therefore, Ravi must work in Lab-South.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \n   We verify that our reasoning does not commit any logical fallacies. The syllogism follows the structure of a valid five-member syllogism, and the counterfactual test confirms the conclusion is consistent with the premises. No fallacies are detected.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \n   After thorough analysis without contradictions, we conclude that Ravi works in Lab-South.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nRavi works in **Lab-South**.",
