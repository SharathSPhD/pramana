Then the premise \"It is false that all are on\" would be false. But the premise is given as true, so this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, our original assumption must be wrong.\n\n    # Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n    # Check for fallacies:\n    # - Akhandha (Universalization) is used in the premise.\n    # - Viruddha (Contradiction) is used in the counterfactual reasoning.\n    # - Sadhyoparamara (Circular Reasoning) is not used.\n    # - Asiddha (Unproven Divisors) is not used.\n\n    # Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n    # After analysis, the only conclusion that must be true is (b) At least one light in Room A is off.\n\n    # Answer\n    return \"b\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**: We start by identifying the problem as a logic puzzle requiring the analysis of a negated universal statement.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**: The only information provided is the negation of the universal statement about the lights in Room A.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**: Using the syllogistic form, we derive that if not all lights are on, then at least one must be off.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**: By assuming the opposite (all lights are on), we reach a contradiction with the given premise, confirming our original conclusion.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**: We verify that our reasoning does not fall into any logical fallacies, ensuring the validity of our conclusion.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**: After systematically applying Nyaya methodology, we conclude that option (b) must be true.",
