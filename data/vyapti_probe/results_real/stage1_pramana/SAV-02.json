It starts by listing doubts, then gathers all known facts, applies direct perception to extract properties, constructs a syllogism to infer the conclusion, uses counterfactual reasoning to validate the conclusion, checks for fallacies, and finally ascertains the conclusion. The final answer is that Species H does have echolocation.",
