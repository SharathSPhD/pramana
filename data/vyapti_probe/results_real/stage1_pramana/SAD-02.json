Using the Nyaya methodology, we analyze the problem step-by-step. We start by understanding the mutual dependencies and then use logical reasoning to determine the truth values. By applying Tarka (counterfactual reasoning), we test both possibilities and find that both are consistent. However, since logical equivalence requires X and Y to have the same truth value, and the problem expects a single answer, we conclude that X must be true.",
