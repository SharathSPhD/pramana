The doubt arises because we need to confirm whether this proposition is true or not. The possible doubts are:\n\n- **Doubt of Inception (Abh\u0101va-doubt):** Is the proposition itself real or imaginary? The proposition is real because it refers to an actual state of affairs.\n- **Doubt of Inclusion (Sampr\u0101ya-doubt):** Are all the lights in Room A on? This is the main doubt we need to resolve.\n- **Doubt of Exclusion (Vy\u0101khy\u0101-tarika-doubt):** Is the proposition excluding some lights? No, the proposition includes all lights.\n- **Doubt of Exposition (Vij\u00f1\u0101pita-doubt):** Is the proposition based on perception? Yes, but we need to confirm the perception.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\nThe sources of knowledge for this problem are:\n\n- **Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):** If I observe that all lights in Room A are on, this is a direct source of knowledge.\n- **Anumana (Inference):** If I know that lights are typically on or off, and I have evidence from perception, I can infer that all lights are on.\n- **Shabda (Word Testimony):** The words \"all\" and \"are on\" convey the meaning that every light is on.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\nWe can construct a syllogism to establish the truth of the statement:\n\n**Pratijna (Thesis):** All the lights in Room A are on.\n\n**Hetu (Reason):** Because I have directly perceived that all the lights in Room A are on.\n\n**Udaharana (Example):** For example, if I directly perceive that all the books on the table are open, then all the books on the table are open.\n\n**Upanaya (Application):** Applying this to our case, all the lights in Room A are on.\n\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, all the lights in Room A are on.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the validity of the statement:\n\n**Tarka 1:** Suppose all the lights in Room A are not on. Then, the original statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" would be false. This contradicts our knowledge that the statement is true.\n\n**Tarka 2:** Suppose some lights in Room A are off. Then, the original statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" would be false. This again contradicts our knowledge that the statement is true.\n\n**Tarka 3:** Suppose at least one light in Room A is on. Then, the original statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" would still require all lights to be on. This does not contradict the statement but is a weaker condition.\n\n**Tarka 4:** Suppose no lights in Room A are off. Then, the original statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" is equivalent. This does not contradict the statement but is a restatement.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n\n- **Doubt of Inception:** The proposition is real, so no fallacy here.\n- **Doubt of Inclusion:** The proposition includes all lights, so no fallacy.\n- **Doubt of Exclusion:** The proposition does not exclude any lights, so no fallacy.\n- **Doubt of Exposition:** The proposition is based on perception, so no fallacy.\n- **Kala-doubt (Temporal Fallacy):** The proposition does not depend on time, so no fallacy.\n- **N\u0101ma-doubt (Name Fallacy):** The proposition refers to lights, not names, so no fallacy.\n- **K\u0101ra-doubt (Causal Fallacy):** The proposition does not rely on causes, so no fallacy.\n- **H\u012bna-doubt (Minimalist Fallacy):** The proposition is about all lights, not just some, so no fallacy.\n- **Savyabhich\u0101ra-doubt (Circular Reasoning):** Our reasoning does not rely on circular logic, so no fallacy.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\nAfter analyzing all phases, we can ascertain the truth of the statement:\n\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, all the lights in Room A are on.\n\n**Verification:** To verify, we can check each light individually or observe the room. If all lights are on, the statement holds true.\n\n**Final Answer:** (c) Both (a) and (b).\n---\n\n### Solution Code:\n```python\n# Nyaya Analysis: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\n# The statement is a universal affirmative proposition.
