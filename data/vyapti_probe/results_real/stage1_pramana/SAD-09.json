Then the survey respondents would not report accurate results. This contradicts the evidence. Therefore, Methodology M must be reliable.\n\n**Hetvabhasa** (Fallacy Check):\nThe argument avoids **Kala Upasana** (Time Idealism), **Nigrahaka** (Mentalism), **Hetal Upasana** (Dualism), and **Amananta** (Materialism). No fallacies are committed.\n\n**Nirnaya** (Ascertainment):\nThe argument is logically valid and reliable.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe argument is logically valid. The methodology is reliable.",
