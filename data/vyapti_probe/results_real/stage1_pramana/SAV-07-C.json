Pratyaksha: Direct Observation: All compounds containing X react.\n    # 2. Anumana: Inference: All acidic compounds react.\n    # 3. Pratyaksha: Direct Observation: Compound \u03b6 does not contain X.\n    # 4. Anumana: Inference: If a compound does not contain X, it does not react.\n    # 5. Samvaya: Connection: Therefore, the rule is valid.\n    \n    # Tarka: Counterfactual Reasoning\n    # Suppose the rule is false. Then there exists a compound containing X that does not react.\n    # But all compounds containing X react. This leads to contradiction.\n    \n    # Hetvabhasa: Fallacy Check\n    # No fallacies detected.\n    \n    # Nirnaya: Ascertainment\n    # The rule is valid.\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    return \"The rule is valid.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe solution follows the Nyaya methodology to systematically analyze and validate the proposed rule. Each phase checks a different aspect of the reasoning to ensure the rule's validity. The final conclusion is that the rule is indeed correct based on the given data.",
