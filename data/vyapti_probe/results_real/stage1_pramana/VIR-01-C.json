Since Student X has passed the final exam, the rule directly implies that Student X has completed all homework assignments. There is no ambiguity or counterexample provided, so the conclusion is straightforward.\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWhat are the sources of knowledge we rely on for this analysis?  \n**Sources:**  \n1. The rule stated at the school: \"If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.\"  \n2. The fact that Student X has passed the final exam.  \n3. Basic logical reasoning principles.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nWe rely on the given rule and the provided fact to deduce the conclusion. Logical reasoning principles ensure that we correctly apply the rule to the given fact.\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWhat is the syllogism structure used to derive the conclusion?  \n**Syllogism Structure:**  \n1. **Pratijna (Thesis):** Student X has passed the final exam.  \n2. **Hetu (Reason):** If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.  \n3. **Udaharana (Comparison):** Compare Student X's situation to the general rule.  \n4. **Prasanga (Application):** Apply the rule to Student X.  \n5. **Nigamana (Conclusion):** Student X has completed all homework assignments.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nWe apply the universal rule to the specific case of Student X, using comparison, counterfactual reasoning, and logical syllogism to derive the conclusion.\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWhat counterfactual reasoning supports our conclusion?  \n**Counterfactual:**  \n- **Assumption:** Student X has not completed all homework assignments.  \n- **Consequence:** If Student X has not completed all homework assignments, then passing the final exam would contradict the rule.  \n- **Analysis:** This contradicts the given fact that Student X has passed the final exam and the rule linking passing to completing homework.  \n- **Resolution:** Therefore, our original conclusion must be true.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThe counterfactual test confirms that our conclusion does not lead to contradictions with the given premises.\n---\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWhat fallacies could challenge our conclusion, and how do we refute them?  \n**Fallacy:**  \n- **Assumption:** The rule does not necessarily imply completing homework.  \n- **Fallacy Type:** *Akrama* (Unwarranted Assumption).  \n- **Refutation:** The rule explicitly states that passing the final exam implies completing homework. There is no indication that the rule is conditional or has exceptions in this context.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nWe systematically check for fallacies and confirm that our reasoning adheres to logical principles without unwarranted assumptions.\n---\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWhat is the final, ascertained conclusion?  \n**Final Conclusion:**  \nStudent X has completed all homework assignments.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThrough systematic reasoning, counterfactual testing, and logical syllogism, we conclude that Student X must have completed all homework assignments based on the given rule and the fact that Student X passed the final exam.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nStudent X has completed all homework assignments.",
