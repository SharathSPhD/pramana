The problem statement.\n2. Common knowledge about Michelin stars and restaurants.\n3. Common knowledge about dish types and ordering.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The problem provides direct information about each person's dish and the restaurant's features.\n- Michelin stars are known to relate to the quality and variety of dishes served.\n- Exposed brick walls are a common feature in certain types of restaurants, potentially indicating a specific cuisine.\n\n**Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nConstruct a syllogism with five members.\n\n**Syllogism Structure:**\n1. Major premise: If X, then Y.\n2. Minor premise: This is X.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, this is Y.\n\n**Members:**\n1. Major premise: If a restaurant has three Michelin stars, then it serves pasta, sushi, and salad.\n2. Minor premise: The restaurant has three Michelin stars.\n3. Conclusion: Therefore, the restaurant serves pasta, sushi, and salad.\n\n**Justification:**\n- Michelin stars are awarded based on the quality and variety of dishes, which suggests that a three-star restaurant offers a range of high-quality dishes, including pasta, sushi, and salad.\n\n**Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nTest our conclusion with counterfactuals.\n\n**Counterfactual 1:**\n- Suppose the restaurant does not serve pasta.\n- Then, Jun would have to order sushi or salad.\n- However, Kira already orders sushi, so Lev would order salad.\n- But this contradicts the conclusion that Lev orders salad, so the original conclusion must be correct.\n\n**Counterfactual 2:**\n- Suppose the restaurant does not serve sushi.\n- Then, Kira would have to order pasta or salad.\n- But Jun does not order pasta, so Kira would order salad.\n- However, Lev would then have to order pasta, which contradicts the conclusion that Lev orders salad, so the original conclusion must be correct.\n\n**Counterfactual 3:**\n- Suppose the restaurant does not serve salad.\n- Then, Jun, Kira, and Lev would have to order pasta and sushi.\n- But this is impossible since each person orders a different dish, so the restaurant must serve salad.\n\n**Justification:**\n- Each counterfactual leads to a contradiction unless the original conclusion holds, confirming the validity of our reasoning.\n\n**Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nCheck for fallacies in our reasoning.\n\n**Fallacies Checked:**\n1. Begging the question: We assume what we are trying to prove.\n2. Appeal to popularity: We rely on majority opinion without justification.\n3. straw man: We misrepresent opponents' views.\n4. ad hominem: We attack the person rather than the argument.\n\n**Results:**\n- No fallacies are present in our reasoning.\n- Our premises are justified by independent sources (Michelin stars and restaurant features).\n\n**Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nFinal conclusion after eliminating all doubts.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nLev orders salad.\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nprint(\"### Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis) ###\")\nprint(\"What do we know and what do we doubt?\")\nprint(\"\\n**Known Facts:**\")\nprint(\"- Jun does not order pasta.\")\nprint(\"- The restaurant has three Michelin stars.\")\nprint(\"- Kira orders sushi.\")\nprint(\"- The restaurant's interior features exposed brick walls.\")\nprint(\"\\n**Unknowns:**\")\nprint(\"- What does Lev order?\")\nprint(\"- What is the relationship between the restaurant's Michelin stars and the dishes ordered?\")\nprint(\"\\n**Doubts:**\")\nprint(\"- How do the Michelin stars relate to the dishes ordered?\")\nprint(\"- Is there a connection between the restaurant's interior and the dishes served?\")\nprint(\"\\n**Questions:**\")\nprint(\"- Does the number of Michelin stars indicate anything about the dishes served?\")\nprint(\"- How does the restaurant's interior (exposed brick walls) influence the dishes available?\")\n\n# Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nprint(\"\\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge) ###\")\nprint(\"Where do we get our knowledge?\")\nprint(\"\\n**Sources:**\")\nprint(\"- The problem statement.\")\nprint(\"- Common knowledge about Michelin stars and restaurants.\")\nprint(\"- Common knowledge about dish types and ordering.\")\nprint(\"\\n**Justification:**\")\nprint(\"- The problem provides direct information about each person's dish and the restaurant's features.\")\nprint(\"- Michelin stars are known to relate to the quality and variety of dishes served.\")\nprint(\"- Exposed brick walls are a common feature in certain types of restaurants, potentially indicating a specific cuisine.\")\n\n# Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nprint(\"\\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism) ###\")\nprint(\"Construct a syllogism with five members.\")\nprint(\"\\n**Syllogism Structure:**\")\nprint(\"1.
