Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \n*What is the question?*  \nThe librarian's statement is true or false?  \n*What do we need to prove?*  \nWe need to verify whether all recommended books are available.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \nThe information provided is the authoritative source. The tags for each book are reliable and accurate.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \n**Pratijna (Thesis):** The librarian's statement is true.  \n**Heti (Reason):** All recommended books have the [Available] tag.  \n**Udaharana (Example):** \"Algorithms\" is recommended and available.  \n**Upanaya (Application):** Since all recommended books share the same tags, they are all available.  \n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, the librarian's statement is true.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \nAssume the statement is false: There exists a recommended book that is not available. This leads to a contradiction with the given tags. Hence, the original statement must be true.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \nNo fallacies are present in the reasoning. The syllogism follows valid logical structure.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \nThe librarian's statement is true. All recommended books are available.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe librarian's statement is **true**. All recommended books are available.",
