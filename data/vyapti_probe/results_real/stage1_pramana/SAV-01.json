We need to determine if Gita, a new hire in Engineering, works remotely.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** The information about the six employees is our base knowledge. Gita's assignment is derived from this.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** \n   - **Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):** All employees in Engineering are in the same department.\n   - **Anumana (Inference):** If an employee is in Engineering, they are either in Engineering (remote) or on-site.\n   - **Pratyaksha:** Aarav is in Engineering and works remotely.\n   - **Samavyaya:** All employees in Engineering who work remotely are in the same category.\n   - **Upanaya:** Gita, being a new hire in Engineering, must follow the same pattern.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** Assuming Gita works on-site leads to a contradiction (she would be male), so she must work remotely.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** No fallacies are present; the reasoning is valid.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** Gita must work remotely.",
