The veterinarian needs to confirm if there's any evidence that contradicts this.\n\n**Analysis:** The records show most Labradors are friendly, but there's no information about Rex specifically. Without knowing Rex's behavior, the veterinarian can't be certain all Labradors are friendly.\n\n**Question:** Is there any information about Rex's friendliness to children?\n\n**Answer:** No, Rex's status isn't provided.\n\n**Resolution:** The veterinarian must check Rex's records before making the assurance.\n---\n\n### Nyaya Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n**Sources:** \n- Clinic records for Max, Bella, Rocky, Duke, Luna, Coco, and Buddy.\n- Rex's individual record if available.\n\n**Justification:** The clinic's records are the primary source. If Rex's record isn't available, the veterinarian must rely on the existing data.\n\n**Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):** The records explicitly state each dog's behavior.\n\n**Anumana (Inference):**

family must infer based on existing data.\n\n**Pratyabhisanjna (Conclusive Reasoning):** Rex's status determines the validity of the assurance.\n\n**Pratyabhirodha (Conflict):** Without Rex's record, there's uncertainty.\n\n**Pratyabhinata (Clarity):** Rex's record must be checked for clarity.\n\n**Pratyabhipti (Comprehension):** Understanding the implications of Rex's status.\n\n**Pratyabhipraya (Intention):** To provide accurate information to the family.\n\n**Pratyabhiprashna (Question):** Can the veterinarian assure the family based on the available information?\n\n**Pratyabhiprasthana (Root Question):** Is the statement \"Labradors from our clinic are friendly to children\" true?\n\n**Pratyabhipratipaksha (Counter-Question):** Is there any evidence that contradicts the statement?\n\n**Pratyabhipratipatti (Answer):** No, unless Rex's record shows otherwise.\n\n**Pratyabhipratilabha (Seeking Reason):** Why is Rex's record necessary?\n\n**Pratyabhipratilamana (Supporting Reason):** Because Rex's status affects the generalization.\n\n**Pratyabhipratirhita (Established Reason):** Without Rex's record, the statement isn't universally
