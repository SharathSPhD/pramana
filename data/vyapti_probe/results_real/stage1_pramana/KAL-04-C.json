Pratyaksha: Direct Observation: User A was granted access on Jan 1.\n    # 2. Anumana: Inference: The access was valid until revoked.\n    # 3. Samjana: Concept: Access revocation on Mar 15 affects all prior access.\n    # 4. Pratyaksha: Direct Observation: Access was revoked on Mar 15.\n    # 5. Samjana: Concept: Access is granted until revoked.\n    \n    # Tarka: Counterfactual Reasoning\n    # If access was not granted on Feb 1, then the system would not have granted access on Jan 1.\n    # But the system did grant access on Jan 1, so it must have granted access on Feb 1.\n    \n    # Hetvabhasa: Fallacy Check\n    # No fallacies detected in the reasoning.\n    \n    # Nirnaya: Ascertainment\n    # Therefore, the system should have granted User A access to Server X on February 1.\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe access control system grants access until it is revoked. Since the revoke happened on March 15, all access granted before this date remains valid. Therefore, User A should have access on February 1.",
