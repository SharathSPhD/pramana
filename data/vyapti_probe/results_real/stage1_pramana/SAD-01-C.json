Object X has a molecular weight of 750, which is greater than 500. Using the Nyaya methodology, we systematically analyze doubt, establish sources of knowledge, construct a syllogism, test counterfactuals, check for fallacies, and conclude that Object X has Property B and is Concept A.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Yes, Object X has property B and is Concept A.**",
