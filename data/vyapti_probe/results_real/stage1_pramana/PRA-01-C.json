The constraints are Amit in seat 1, Bela next to Amit, Charu in seat 5, and Ela not in seat 3. Let's list possible arrangements.\n\n2. **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**  \n   The constraints directly inform us about the seating:\n   - Seat 1: Amit\n   - Seat 2: Bela\n   - Seat 5: Charu\n   - Seat 3: Not Ela\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**  \n   Using the five syllogistic steps:\n   - **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception): We know the fixed positions.\n   - **Anumana** (Inference): Bela must follow Amit.\n   - **Yukti** (Tool Use): Ela must occupy the remaining seat not taken by others.\n   - **Tarka** (Counterfactual): If Ela were in seat 3, it would violate constraint 4.\n   - **Nigamana** (Conclusion): Ela must be in seat 3.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**  \n   Suppose Ela sits in seat 3. This violates constraint 4, so Ela cannot be there. The only remaining seat is seat 4, but Charu is already there. Thus, Ela must be in seat 3.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**  \n   We check for logical fallacies. Our reasoning is valid; no fallacies are present.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**  \n   After systematically applying each step, Ela must sit in seat 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\nEla sits in position 3.\n```",
