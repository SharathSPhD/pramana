This problem can be analyzed using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology to systematically derive the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis):**\nStudent A has a doubt about whether they can check out a third book during summer session. The policy states a maximum of 2 books, but Student A already has 2 checked out and wants to check out a third.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):**\nThe policy is a reliable source of knowledge. It clearly states the maximum number of books that can be checked out during summer session.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):**\n**Pratijna (Thesis):** Student A can check out the third book.\n**Hetu (Reason):** The policy allows a maximum of 2 books during summer session. Student A already has 2 books checked out. Checking out a third book would exceed the policy limit.\n**Udaharana (Example):** If a student has already checked out the maximum allowed books, they cannot check out additional books.\n**Upanaya (Application):** Since Student A has reached the maximum, they cannot check out another book.\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):** Therefore, Student A cannot check out the third book.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):**\n**Prahraya (Assumption):** Suppose Student A can check out the third book.\n**Prasanga (Consequence):** This would mean the policy allows more than 2 books during summer session.\n**Viruddhakarana (Counterexample):** However, the policy explicitly states a maximum of 2 books.\n**Tarka Samgraha (Counterfactual Conclusion):** Therefore, the assumption is false, and Student A cannot check out the third book.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**\n**Kala (Time):** The policy is specific to summer session.\n**Samanya (Generality):** The policy applies to all students during summer session.\n**Nigamana (Inference):** The inference is valid because the policy explicitly limits the number of books.\n**Hetvabhasa Samgraha (Fallacy Conclusion):** No fallacies are present in the reasoning.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**\nAfter systematically analyzing the policy, applying logical reasoning, and verifying through counterfactuals, the conclusion is definitive. Student A cannot check out the third book during summer session as it exceeds the policy limit.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nStudent A cannot check out the third book during summer session.",
