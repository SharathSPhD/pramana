Premise 4: All residents drive sedans.\n\n**Justification:**\n- Premise 1 is a general rule about surgeons.\n- Premise 2 is a specific fact about Dr. Kapoor.\n- Premise 4 is a general rule about residents.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The premises are the sources of our knowledge.\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n**Syllogism Structure:**\n1. Pratijna (Thesis): Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n2. Hetu (Reason): All surgeons are residents (Premise 1) and Dr. Kapoor is a surgeon (Premise 2).\n3. Udaharana (Example): All surgeons are residents (example: Dr. Smith is a surgeon, therefore Dr. Smith is a resident).\n4. Prasanga (Comparison): Dr. Kapoor is a surgeon, so Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n5. Nigamana (Conclusion): Therefore, Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n\n**Proof:**\n- From Premise 1 and 2, by universal syllogism, Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Counterfactuals:**\n1. If Dr. Kapoor were not a resident, he couldn't be a surgeon. (Premise 1)\n2. If Dr. Kapoor were not a surgeon, we wouldn't know he is a resident. (Premise 2)\n3. If Dr. Kapoor did not drive a sedan, he wouldn't be a resident. (Premise 4)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- If Dr. Kapoor weren't a resident, he couldn't be a surgeon (Premise 1). So, Dr. Kapoor must be a resident.\n- If Dr. Kapoor weren't a surgeon, we wouldn't know he is a resident (Premise 2). But we know he is a surgeon, so he must be a resident.\n- If Dr. Kapoor didn't drive a sedan, he wouldn't be a resident (Premise 4). But he is a resident, so he must drive a sedan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- All premises are necessary for the conclusions.\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n**Fallacies Checked:**\n1. Akhandaka: Dr. Kapoor is a resident because all surgeons are residents. (Valid)\n2. Viruddha: No premises contradict each other. (Valid)\n3. Sadhyasama: No fallacy of assuming the conclusion. (Valid)\n4. Hetu-kutva: No fallacy of incorrect reason. (Valid)\n5. Matlabha: No fallacy of incorrect premises. (Valid)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No fallacies detected.\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n**Final Knowledge:**\n- Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n- Dr. Kapoor drives a sedan.\n\n**Justification:**\n- From Premise 1 and 2, Dr. Kapoor is a resident.\n- From Premise 4, all residents drive sedans, so Dr. Kapoor drives a sedan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- We can validly conclude that Dr. Kapoor is a resident and drives a sedan.\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nWe can validly conclude that Dr. Kapoor is a resident and drives a sedan.",
