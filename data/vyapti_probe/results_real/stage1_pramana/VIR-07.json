Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\n**Problem Statement:**  \nThe backup system has not activated.  \nWe need to determine what conclusions can be drawn from the given premise.\n\n**Doubt Analysis:**\n- **What do we know?**  \n  The backup system activates if the server is overloaded OR the network is down.  \n  The backup system has NOT activated.  \n\n- **What are we trying to find out?**  \n  We need to determine the reason why the backup system did not activate.  \n\n**Possible Doubts:**  \n1. The server is not overloaded.  \n2. The network is not down.  \n3. Both the server is not overloaded AND the network is not down.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \nWe need to analyze the logical structure of the premise to determine the possible reasons for the backup system not activating.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n**Premise:**  \n- If (Server is overloaded) OR (Network is down), then Backup System activates.  \n- Backup System has NOT activated.  \n\n**Sources of Knowledge:**  \n1. The logical structure of the premise.  \n2. The truth values of the propositions involved.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nWe know that the backup system activates if either the server is overloaded or the network is down. Since the backup system has not activated, at least one of these conditions must be false. This leads us to analyze the logical implications.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n**Syllogism Structure:**  \n**Pratijna (Thesis):**  \nThe backup system activates if (Server is overloaded OR Network is down).  \n\n**Heti (Reason):**  \nBecause (Server is overloaded OR Network is down).  \n\n**Udaharana (Example):**  \nExample: If (A OR B), then (Backup activates).  \n\n**Savyaya (Comparison):**  \nBackup system has NOT activated.  \n\n**Nigamana (Conclusion):**  \nTherefore, (Server is not overloaded AND Network is not down).  \n\n**Tattva (Truth):**  \nThe truth of the conclusion is established through logical analysis.  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nUsing the structure of a syllogism, we derive that both the server being overloaded and the network being down must be false for the backup system not to activate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Counterfactual Analysis:**  \nAssume the backup system activates only if either the server is overloaded OR the network is down.  \n\n**Counterfactual Hypothesis:**  \nSuppose the backup system activates even if the server is not overloaded AND the network is not down.  \n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**  \nIf both the server is not overloaded and the network is not down, then the premise condition (Server is overloaded OR Network is down) is false. Therefore, the backup system should not activate, which aligns with the observation.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \nThe counterfactual hypothesis does not contradict the premise, but it does not provide additional information. Thus, we cannot conclude that the server is overloaded or the network is down.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n**Fallacy Identification:**  \nWe need to ensure that our reasoning does not fall into common logical fallacies such as:  \n1. **Akwardening the Premise (Akrasia)**: Assuming the premise is true without justification.  \n2. **Denying the Antecedent (Modus Tollens)**: Drawing incorrect conclusions from negated antecedents.  \n3. **Conjunction Fallacy**: Misapplying logical connectives.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The premise is a standard logical OR statement.  \n- The conclusion follows correctly from the negation of the premise.  \n- No fallacies are present in the reasoning.  \n\n**Justification:**  \nOur syllogistic approach correctly applies the logical structure of the premise to derive the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n**Final Conclusion:**  \nBased on the logical structure and the given observations, we can conclude that:  \n**\"The server is not overloaded AND the network is not down.\"**\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe backup system activates if either the server is overloaded OR the network is down. Since the backup system has not activated, both conditions must be false. This is a direct consequence of the logical OR structure and the negation of the backup system's activation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**\"The server is not overloaded AND the network is not down.\"**",
