(Sources of Knowledge)**:\n   - What are the facts (pramana)?\n   - What are the inferences (nigamana)?\n   - What are the reasons (hetu)?\n   - What are the examples (dharma)?\n   - What is the testimony (sabda)?\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**:\n   - Pratijna (Thesis): \n   - Hetu (Reason):\n   - Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):\n   - Anumana (Inference):\n   - Upanaya (Application).\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**:\n   - Assume the negation of the claim.\n   - What follows from this assumption?\n   - Does this contradict any known facts?\n   - What is the consequence of the contradiction?\n   - What is the resolution?\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**:\n   - Which fallacy does the argument commit?\n   - How does the argument avoid falling into this fallacy?\n   - What is the alternative fallacy?\n   - What is the alternative conclusion?\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**:\n   - What is the final conclusion?\n   - What is the reason for this conclusion?\n   - What is the supporting evidence?\n   - What is the basis for the conclusion?\n   - What is the ultimate truth?\n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Syllogism Template:\n**Pratijna (Thesis):**  \n*All S are P.  \n\n**Hetu (Reason):**  \n*S is P because S is P.  \n\n**Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):**  \n*I directly perceive S is P.  \n\n**Anumana (Inference):**  \n*Since S is P, then S is P.  \n\n**Upanaya (Application):**  \n*Therefore, all S are P.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Tarka Template:\n**Assumption:**  \n*Not all S are P.  \n\n**Consequence:**  \n*This leads to the conclusion that S is not P.  \n\n**Contradiction:**  \n*This contradicts our known facts that S is P.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \n*Therefore, our original claim must be true.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Hetvabhasa Template:\n**Fallacy Committed:**  \n*The argument commits the [fallacy name].  \n\n**Avoiding the Fallacy:**  \n*The argument avoids falling into this fallacy by [reason].  \n\n**Alternative Fallacy:**  \n*If we consider the alternative fallacy, [fallacy name], then [conclusion].  \n\n**Alternative Conclusion:**  \n*Therefore, the alternative conclusion is [alternative].  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Nirnaya Template:\n**Final Conclusion:**  \n*All S are P.  \n\n**Reason:**  \n*[Reason].  \n\n**Supporting Evidence:**  \n*[Evidence].  \n\n**Basis for Conclusion:**  \n*[Basis].  \n\n**Ultimate Truth:**  \n*The ultimate truth is that all S are P.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Syllogism Diagram:\n```\nPratijna (Thesis)  \n       \u2193  \nHetu (Reason)  \n       \u2193  \nPratyaksha (Direct

white.  \n\n**Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):**  \n*I directly perceive swans are white.  \n\n**Anumana (Inference):**  \n*Since swans are white, then swans are white.  \n\n**Upanaya (Application):**  \n*Therefore, all swans are white.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Tarka Example:\n**Assumption:**  \n*Not all swans are white.  \n\n**Consequence:**  \n*This leads to the conclusion that some swans are not white.  \n\n**Contradiction:**  \n*This contradicts our known facts that swans are white.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \n*Therefore, our original claim must be true.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Hetvabhasa Example:\n**Fallacy Committed:**  \n*The argument commits the fallacy of the Universal Excluded Middle.  \n\n**Avoiding the Fallacy:**  \n*The argument avoids falling into this fallacy by not asserting that some swans are not white.  \n\n**Alternative Fallacy:**  \n*If we consider the alternative fallacy of the Universal Excluded Middle, then some swans are not white.  \n\n**Alternative Conclusion:**  \n*Therefore, the alternative conclusion is that some swans are not white.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Nirnaya Example:\n**Final Conclusion:**  \n*All swans are white.  \n\n**Reason:**  \n*Swans are white because swans are white.  \n\n**Supporting Evidence:**  \n*I directly perceive swans are white.  \n\n**Basis for Conclusion:**  \n*The reason is that swans are white.  \n\n**Ultimate Truth:**  \n*The ultimate truth is that all swans are white.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Syllogism Diagram with Example:\n```\nPratijna (Thesis)  \n       \u2193  \nHetu (Reason)  \n

Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Hetu (Reason):**  \n*Patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered because patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Pratyaksha (Direct Perception):**  \n*I directly perceive that all patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Anumana (Inference):**  \n*Since patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered, then patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Upanaya (Application):**  \n*Therefore, all patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Tarka with Patient Data:\n**Assumption:**  \n*Not all patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Consequence:**  \n*This leads to the conclusion that some patients with Condition X who received Treatment T did not recover.  \n\n**Contradiction:**  \n*This contradicts our known facts that all patients with Condition X who received Treatment T recovered.  \n\n**Resolution:**  \n*Therefore, our original claim must be true.  \n\n---\n\n### Nyaya Hetvabhasa with Patient Data:\n**Fallacy Committed:**  \n*The argument
