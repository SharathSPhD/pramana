These facts do not contradict the rule, as the rule specifies that all compounds containing element X undergo the reaction, not that all compounds that undergo the reaction contain element X.\n\n**Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** If the rule were false, then at least one compound containing element X would not undergo the reaction. However, all compounds containing element X (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b5) do undergo the reaction, so the rule cannot be false.\n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** The rule is valid based on the given data.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes, the rule is valid.}}",
