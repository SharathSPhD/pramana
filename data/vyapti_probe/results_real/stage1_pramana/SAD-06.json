  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Nyaya Analysis:\n\n**1. Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: The classification system's rules and the analyst's reasoning create a potential contradiction. If all Type-X objects must have Feature-P, and Object Q has Feature-P, does it necessarily follow that Object Q is Type-X? This is a point of doubt.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: The classification rules and the analyst's observation are considered valid sources of knowledge. The classification system defines Feature-P as exclusive to Type-X, and the analyst's observation is a direct perception of Feature-P in Object Q.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: Using the syllogistic structure:  \n- **Pratijna** (Thesis): Object Q is Type-X.  \n- **Heti** (Reason): Object Q has Feature-P.  \n- **Udaharana** (Example): All Type-X objects have Feature-P.  \n- **Prasanga** (Application): Since Object Q has Feature-P, it is Type-X.  \n- **Nigamana** (Conclusion): Therefore, Object Q is Type-X.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: If Object Q were not Type-X, it would contradict the definition of Feature-P as exclusive to Type-X. Therefore, Object Q must be Type-X.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: The reasoning avoids fallacies such as *Kala Prapatti* (temporal accommodation) and *Nigrahasthana* (overcompensation). The classification is logically consistent.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \n*Vyakhyana*: The classification is valid because the analyst's reasoning aligns with the defined rules, and the syllogistic structure holds without contradiction.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe classification is logically valid.",
