First, it identifies known assignments and initializes Ravi's lab as unknown. By analyzing the number of researchers in Lab-South and considering the known assignments, it logically deduces that Ravi must work in Lab-South to satisfy the problem constraints. The final answer is confirmed through a structured reasoning process.",
