It starts by identifying the doubt, verifies the sources of knowledge (pramana) through empirical test results and the circuit manual, uses counterfactual reasoning (tarka) to test the validity of the hypothesis, constructs a syllogism (pancha avayava) to logically structure the proof, checks for fallacies (hetvabhasa) to ensure the reasoning is sound, and finally ascertains (nirnaya) the conclusion. This structured approach ensures that the hypothesis is thoroughly validated and any potential doubts are resolved.",
