It starts by identifying the doubt, then examines the events to gather knowledge. Using a syllogistic structure, it builds the argument that whenever sensor A is triggered, the alarm sounds. Counterfactual reasoning checks if the claim holds in all scenarios, and fallacy checks ensure the logic is sound. The final conclusion validates the security company's claim.",
