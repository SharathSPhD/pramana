This means the librarian's statement is a valid source of knowledge.\n\n3. **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \n   - **Pratijna (Thesis):** All recommended books are available.  \n   - **Hetu (Reason):** Every recommended book is marked as [Available].  \n   - **Udaharana (Example):** \"Algorithms\" and \"Bioinformatics\" are recommended and available.  \n   - **Upanaya (Application):** Since all recommended books share the [Available] tag, they must all be available.  \n   - **Nigamana (Inference):** Therefore, the librarian's statement is true.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \n   - **Hypothesis:** Suppose a recommended book is not available.  \n   - **Consequence:** The librarian's statement would be false.  \n   - **Rebuttal:** However, all recommended books are available.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The librarian's statement is true.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \n   We check for common fallacies:  \n   - **Denying the Conclusion:** Not applicable.  \n   - **Affirming the Premise:** Not applicable.  \n   - **Denying the Antecedent:** Not applicable.  \n   - **Concluding from Insufficient Evidence:** Not applicable.  \n   No fallacies are committed in this reasoning.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \n   After thorough analysis, we conclude that the librarian's statement is true. All recommended books are available in the catalog.\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe librarian's statement is **true**. All recommended books are available in the catalog.",
