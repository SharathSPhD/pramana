Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**  \n*What is known?*  \n- Rishi owns a bicycle.  \n- All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.  \n*What is in doubt?*  \n- Does Rishi live within 5 km of the campus?  \n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**  \n*Sources of Knowledge:*  \n- The statement \"All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus\" is a general rule.  \n- Rishi is a specific bicycle owner.  \n*Justification:*  \n- The rule applies to all bicycle owners, including Rishi.  \n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**  \n**Thesis**: Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.  \n**Reasoning**:  \n1. **Pratyaksha** (Direct Perception): Rishi owns a bicycle.  \n2. **Anumana** (Inference): All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.  \n3. **Upanaya** (Application): Since Rishi is a bicycle owner, he must live within 5 km.  \n4. **Prasanga** (Comparison): If all bicycle owners live within 5 km, then Rishi does too.  \n5. **Nigamana** (Conclusion): Therefore, Rishi lives within 5 km.  \n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**  \n*Counterfactuals Examined:*  \n- If Rishi did not own a bicycle, then he would not be subject to the rule.  \n- If the rule did not apply to all bicycle owners, then Rishi might not live within 5 km.  \n*Justification:*  \n- Rishi owns a bicycle, making him subject to the rule.  \n- The rule applies universally to all bicycle owners, ensuring Rishi's proximity.  \n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**  \n*Fallacies Checked:*  \n- **Ekaikantaka** (One-sidedness): No bias is introduced in the reasoning.  \n- **Dristi** (Vision): No misleading evidence is presented.  \n- **Asiddhatva** (Universalization): The rule is correctly applied to Rishi.  \n*Justification:*  \n- The reasoning is logical and free from fallacies.  \n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**  \n*Final Determination:*  \n- Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Yes, Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.**",
