By systematically applying the Nyaya methodology, we analyze the relationships between X and Y. Through direct perception and inference, we determine that X must be true given that Y is true and X is logically dependent on Y. Counterfactual reasoning confirms this conclusion, and a thorough check for logical fallacies ensures the validity of the solution. The final conclusion is that X is true.",
