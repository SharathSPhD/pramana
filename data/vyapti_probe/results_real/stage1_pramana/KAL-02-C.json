  "raw_response": "### Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWhat is the puzzle presented in Phase 1?\n\nThe puzzle is presented in two phases. Phase 1 is Samshaya (Doubt Analysis), where you analyze the problem and articulate all doubts and questions.\n\nPhase 2 is the actual puzzle.\n\nSo, in Phase 1, we need to define the problem and identify all uncertainties.\n\nBut the problem statement is: \"A puzzle is presented in two phases.\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing. It seems like the puzzle itself is presented in two phases, but Phase 1 is Samshaya, so perhaps the puzzle is about something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the puzzle is about a riddle or a logical problem that is presented in two phases.\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit unclear. Let me try to interpret it.\n\nThe problem says: \"A puzzle is presented in two phases.\" So the puzzle itself is divided into two parts or phases.\n\nPhase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis) - where we analyze the problem and articulate all doubts.\n\nPhase 2: The actual puzzle.\n\nSo, the problem is that a puzzle is presented in two phases. So, perhaps the puzzle is about something that is presented in two phases, and we need to figure out what that is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the puzzle is about a riddle that is presented in two phases, and we need to solve it.\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit vague. So, perhaps the puzzle is about something that is presented in two phases, and we need to figure out what that is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle is about a riddle that is presented in two phases, and we need to solve it.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to proceed. So, perhaps the puzzle is about a riddle that is presented in two phases, and we need to figure out what the riddle is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the puzzle is about a logical problem that is presented in two phases, and we need to solve it.\n\nBut the problem statement is a bit unclear.
