Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\n\n*What is the question asking?*  \nWe need to determine if Contestant M qualifies for the prize based on the contest rule.\n\n*What are the possibilities?*  \n1. Yes, M qualifies.  \n2. No, M does not qualify.\n\n*What is in doubt?*  \nWhether solving both Problem A and Problem B is sufficient for qualification.\n\n**2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\n\n*What is the premise?*  \n- Contestant M has solved BOTH Problem A and Problem B.\n- The rule states: \"To win a prize, a contestant must solve Problem A or Problem B.\"\n\n*What is the reasoning?*  \nThe rule uses the logical operator \"or,\" which means solving either one satisfies the condition. Since M has solved both, the condition is satisfied.\n\n*What is the conclusion?*  \nM qualifies for the prize.\n\n**3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\n\n**Thesis**: M qualifies for the prize.  \n**Reasoning**: M has solved both Problem A and Problem B, and the rule states that solving either Problem A or Problem B is sufficient for qualification.\n\n**Syllogism Structure**:  \n1. The rule says: If a contestant solves Problem A or Problem B, then they qualify.  \n2. M has solved both Problem A and Problem B.  \n3. Therefore, M qualifies.  \n\n**Verification**:  \n- The premise matches the rule.  \n- The conclusion follows logically.\n\n**4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\n\n*Counterfactual Hypothesis*: Suppose M does not qualify.  \n*Consequence*: If M did not solve either Problem A or Problem B, then M would not qualify.  \n*Contrapositive*: If M qualifies, then M must have solved either Problem A or Problem B.  \n*Reversion*: Since M has solved both, the contrapositive holds.  \n*Conclusion*: M qualifies.\n\n**5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\n\n*Checked Fallacies*:  \n- **Akhandaka** (Universalization): The rule applies to all contestants.  \n- **Drishti** (Perspective): The rule does not depend on contestant perspective.  \n- **Hetu-Kutanga** (Causal Fallacy): The solution of problems is the cause of qualification.  \n- **Savyabhichara** (Circular Reasoning): No circularity in logic.  \n\n*Conclusion*: No fallacies detected in the reasoning.\n\n**6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\n\n*Final Answer*:  \nYes, Contestant M qualifies for the prize because solving both Problem A and Problem B satisfies the \"or\" condition specified in the contest rule.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{Yes}",
