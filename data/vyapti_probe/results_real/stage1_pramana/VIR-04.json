Then, by the rule, they are NOT permitted. However, this contradicts our known fact that Employee Z has completed training. Thus, the conclusion does not hold.\n\n**Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):**  \nNo fallacies are present. The reasoning is valid and follows syllogistic rules.\n\n**Nirnaya (Ascertainment):**  \nEmployee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nYes, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.",
