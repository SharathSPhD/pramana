Since they are not, it's not the window.\n   - **Pratyaksha**: The dog did not bark, implying it barked when the thief was not present.\n   - **Anumana**: If the thief entered through the door, the lock shows scratch marks. Since it does, it's the door.\n   - **Upamana**: If both entry points were possible, there would be a contradiction. Therefore, only the door is possible.\n\n4. **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**: We test the assumption that the thief entered through the window. This leads to a contradiction (no footprints), confirming that the thief must have entered through the door.\n\n5. **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**: We verify that our reasoning does not fall into common logical errors.\n\n6. **Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**: Based on the analysis, we conclude that the thief entered through the door.\n\nThe final answer is **door**.\n```",
