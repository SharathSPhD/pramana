Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\n**Problem Statement:**  \nAn advisor claims: \"Every student who is in both Philosophy and Mathematics is also enrolled in the Logic course.\"\n\n**Doubt Type:**  \nThis is a universal affirmative statement (\"All X are Y\"). The doubt arises if we find even one X that is Y but not Z (or vice versa). The Samshaya phase identifies the nature of the doubt.\n\n**Analysis:**  \nWe need to verify if every student common to both P (Philosophy) and M (Mathematics) is also in L (Logic course enrollees).\n\n**Doubt:**  \nIs the advisor's claim true? Are all common students in L?\n\n**Answer:**  \nSamshaya: Universal affirmative with doubt (Tarka Samshaya). We must verify each common student.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n**Sources:**  \n- P: {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Qasim, Riya}\n- M: {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Sana}\n- L: {Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Tara}\n\n**Pramana:**  \nThe advisor's claim is based on the provided sets. We rely on these sets as the source of truth.\n\n**Answer:**  \nPramana: The sets P, M, and L are the sources of knowledge.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n**Syllogism Structure:**  \n1. Pratijna (Thesis): The advisor's claim: Every student who is in both P and M is also in L.\n2. Hetu (Reason): The common students in P and M are Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya.\n3. Upanaya (Application): Check each common student:\n   - Mira: In L? Yes.\n   - Neel: In L? Yes.\n   - Omar: In L? Yes.\n   - Priya: In L? Yes.\n4. Prasanga (Comparison): All common students are in L.\n5. Nirnaya (Ascertainment): The claim is true.\n\n**Answer:**  \nPancha Avayava: The syllogism confirms the advisor's claim is true.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n**Counterfactual:**  \nAssume the opposite: \"There exists a student who is in both P and M but not in L.\"\n\n**Analysis:**  \nCheck if any common student is missing from L.\n\n**Counterfactual Check:**  \n- Common students: Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya.\n- L contains all four: Mira, Neel, Omar, Priya, Tara.\n- No student is missing.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe counterfactual does not hold; the original claim is true.\n\n**Answer:**  \nTarka: The counterfactual fails, confirming the claim is true.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n**Fallacy Identification:**  \n- Akhandha: No fallacy in syllogism structure.\n- Sadhyasama: No fallacy in premises.\n- Viruddha: No contradictory premises.\n- Asiddha: No uncertain premises.\n\n**Fallacy Check:**  \nAll premises are valid and consistent. No fallacies present.\n\n**Answer:**  \nHetvabhasa: No fallacies; the syllogism is valid.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n**Final Conclusion:**  \nEvery student common to both P and M is also in L. The claim is true.\n\n**Answer:**  \nNirnaya: The advisor's claim is definitively true.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe advisor's claim is true based on the provided data. Every student enrolled in both Philosophy and Mathematics is also enrolled in the Logic course.",
