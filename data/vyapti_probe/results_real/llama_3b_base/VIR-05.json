Set B consists of students who are on the honor roll, which is {q, r, u, v}. The condition for attending study hall is that students must play sports AND not be on the honor roll.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the intersection of sets A and B to find students who play sports and are on the honor roll\nThe intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A \u2229 B, consists of elements that are common to both sets. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {q, r}.\n\n## Step 3: Identify students who play sports but are not on the honor roll\nTo find students who play sports but are not on the honor roll, we need to exclude the students who are on the honor roll from the set of students who play sports. Therefore, the students who play sports but are not on the honor roll are {p, s, t}.\n\n## Step 4: Determine which students must attend study hall\nBased on the condition that students who play sports AND are NOT on the honor roll must attend study hall, the students who must attend study hall are {p, s, t}.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{p, s, t}}$",
