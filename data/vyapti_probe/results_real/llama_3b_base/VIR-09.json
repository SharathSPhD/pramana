It does not state that a senior partner is assigned to all cases, but rather that if a case is classified as high-priority, then a senior partner is assigned. This means that the statement is true for high-priority cases, but it does not provide information about non-high-priority cases. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no senior partner is assigned to Case #247, because we do not have enough information to make that conclusion. The correct answer is \"We cannot conclude anything about the assignment of senior partners to Case #247.\"The correct answer is \"We cannot conclude anything about the assignment of senior partners to Case #247.\" because the conditional statement only tells us that if a case is high-priority, then a senior partner is assigned, but it does not tell us that no senior partner is assigned to non-high-priority cases. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no senior partner is assigned to Case #247.
