Therefore, the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that both tests pass. This is equivalent to saying that the product is rejected if either test fails. Since Product P has failed both tests, it is rejected. However, the question asks whether the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that both tests pass. Since Product P has failed both tests, it is not the case that both tests pass. Therefore, the product is rejected. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as the \"false dilemma.\" The question presents a false dilemma by implying that the product is rejected only if both tests pass. However, the correct interpretation is that the product is rejected if either test fails. The correct answer is \"Yes,\" because the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that both tests pass. \n\nHowever, the question is asking whether the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that both tests pass.
