  "raw_response": "The final answer is: pasta.\n\nExplanation: From statement 3, we know Kira orders sushi. From statement 1, we know Jun does not order pasta. Since the restaurant has won three Michelin stars, it is likely a high-end restaurant. In a high-end restaurant, the interior often features luxurious materials, such as marble or wood. Exposed brick walls are not typically found in high-end restaurants. Therefore, statement 4 is likely false. If statement 4 is false, then Lev must order pasta, as the other two options (sushi and salad) are already taken by Kira and Jun, respectively. Therefore, Lev orders pasta. \n\nNote: This solution uses a combination of logical reasoning and inference to arrive at the correct answer. It requires analyzing the given statements, identifying the relationships between them, and making educated guesses based on the context. \n\nHowever, this solution is not a straightforward application of the rules. It requires a deeper understanding of the context and the relationships between the statements. A more straightforward solution would be to use a truth table to evaluate all possible combinations of dishes ordered by the three friends. \n\nHere is a truth table for the problem:\n\n| Jun | Kira | Lev | Dish |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T   | S   |?   | P   |\n| T   | S   |?   | S   |\n| T   | S   |?   | D   |\n| F   | S   |?   | P   |\n| F   | S   |?   | S   |\n| F   | S   |?   | D   |\n\nIn this table, T represents \"True\", S represents \"Sushi\", P represents \"Pasta\", and D represents \"Salad\". The \"?\" represents the unknown dish ordered by Lev. \n\nFrom statement 1, we know Jun does not order pasta, so we can eliminate the first row. From statement 3, we know Kira orders sushi, so we can eliminate the second and fourth rows. \n\nWe are left with two possible combinations:\n\n| Jun | Kira | Lev | Dish |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T   | S   |?   | S   |\n| F   | S   |?   | D   |\n\nFrom statement 2, we know the restaurant has won three Michelin stars, which implies that the restaurant is high-end. In a high-end restaurant, the interior often features luxurious materials, such as marble or wood. Exposed brick walls are not typically found in high-end restaurants. Therefore, statement 4 is likely false. If statement 4 is false, then Lev must order pasta, as the other two options (sushi and salad) are already taken by Kira and Jun, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is pasta. \n\nThis solution uses a truth table to evaluate all possible combinations of dishes ordered by the three friends. It requires a more systematic approach than the previous solution, but it is a more straightforward way to arrive at the correct answer. \n\nNote: The problem can be solved using a truth table, but the solution provided uses a combination of logical reasoning and inference to arrive at the correct answer.
