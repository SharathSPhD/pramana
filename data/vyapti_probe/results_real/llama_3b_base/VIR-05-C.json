The condition for eligibility is that a student must be in both Set A and Set B to be eligible for the athletics scholarship.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the intersection of Set A and Set B\nTo find the students who are eligible for the athletics scholarship, we need to identify the students who are common to both Set A (students who play sports) and Set B (students who are on the honor roll). This is the intersection of Set A and Set B.\n\n## Step 3: List the common elements\nThe common elements between Set A and Set B are q and r, as they are the only students who appear in both sets.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\{q, r\\}}$",
