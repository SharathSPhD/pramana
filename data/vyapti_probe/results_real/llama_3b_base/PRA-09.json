We need to identify how many subjects are both left-handed and like chocolate.\n\n## Step 2: Count the number of subjects who are left-handed and like chocolate.\nFrom the data, we see that subjects A, E are left-handed and like chocolate.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the total number of subjects who like chocolate.\nThere are 5 subjects who like chocolate.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the percentage of subjects who like chocolate and are left-handed.\nTo calculate the percentage, we divide the number of subjects who are both left-handed and like chocolate by the total number of subjects who like chocolate, and then multiply by 100.\n\n## Step 5: Perform the calculation.\nPercentage = (2 / 5) * 100 = 40%\n\n## Step 6: Determine if being left-handed tells us anything about whether a person likes chocolate.\nSince 40% of the subjects who like chocolate are left-handed, being left-handed does not tell us anything about whether a person likes chocolate.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
