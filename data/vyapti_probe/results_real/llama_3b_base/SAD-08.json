  "raw_response": "The final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis problem can be solved using a graph theory approach. We can represent the tasks and time slots as nodes in a graph, and the constraints as edges between the nodes. \n\nLet's represent the tasks as nodes T1, T2, T3 and the time slots as nodes Morning, Afternoon, Evening. We can draw edges between the nodes as follows:\n\n- T1 -> T2\n- T2 -> T3\n- T3 -> T1\n\nSince the graph is a cycle (T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T1), we can start at any node and traverse the cycle to find a valid schedule. Let's start at node T1. \n\nThe cycle is: T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T1\n\nSo, the valid schedule is: T1 (Morning), T2 (Afternoon), T3 (Evening). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1, which represents the time slot Morning. \n\nNote: The answer is not 2 or 3, because the tasks are not scheduled in the Afternoon or Evening slots. \n\nThis problem can be solved using a graph theory approach, and the solution is a valid schedule that satisfies all the constraints. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$ \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the solution. \n\nI hope it is correct. \n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name] \n\nNote: I've followed the format you specified, but I want to emphasize that the problem is more related to graph theory and scheduling than to numerical computation.
