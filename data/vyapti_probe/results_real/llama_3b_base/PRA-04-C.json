  "raw_response": "The minimum travel time is 6 hours. To get to City D from City A, you can travel from City A to City B (2 hours), then from City B to City C (3 hours), and finally from City C to City D (1 hour). This route takes a total of 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 hours. This is the minimum travel time because it is the shortest path between City A and City D. \n\nHowever, there is another route from City A to City D: City A to City C (3 hours) and then City C to City D (1 hour). This route also takes a total of 3 + 1 = 4 hours, which is less than the original route. Therefore, the minimum travel time from City A to City D is actually 4 hours. \n\nThe correct answer is 4 hours. I apologize for the initial mistake. The correct solution involves considering all possible routes and finding the shortest one. \n\nThe correct reasoning is as follows:\n\n- The minimum travel time from City A to City B is 2 hours.\n- The minimum travel time from City B to City C is 3 hours.\n- The minimum travel time from City C to City D is 1 hour.\n\nTo get to City D from City A, you can travel from City A to City B (2 hours), then from City B to City C (3 hours), and finally from City C to City D (1 hour). This route takes a total of 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 hours.\n\nAlternatively, you can travel from City A to City C (3 hours) and then from City C to City D (1 hour). This route takes a total of 3 + 1 = 4 hours.\n\nThe minimum travel time from City A to City D is 4 hours. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
