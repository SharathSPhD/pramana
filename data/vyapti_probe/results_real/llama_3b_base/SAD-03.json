(2) The Green box does NOT contain the ring.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the puzzle solver's initial reasoning\nThe puzzle solver's reasoning is as follows: \"Assume the Red box contains the key. Then by rule 1, Blue contains the coin. Then Green must contain the ring. But rule 2 says Green doesn't contain the ring. Contradiction! Therefore, Red does NOT contain the key.\"\n\nThe puzzle solver's reasoning is valid because it correctly identifies a contradiction based on the given rules.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the final assignment\nSince the puzzle solver's initial reasoning is valid, we can conclude that Red does not contain the key. We also know that Green does not contain the ring (rule 2). Now we need to find the assignment of items to boxes.\n\n## Step 4: Use the process of elimination\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n- If Red contains the coin, then Blue contains the key (rule 1), and Green contains the ring (by elimination). But this contradicts rule 2, which says Green doesn't contain the ring.\n- If Red contains the ring, then Blue contains the coin (rule 1), and Green contains the key (by elimination). This is a valid assignment.\n\n## Step 5: Finalize the assignment\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that:\n- Red contains the ring.\n- Blue contains the coin.\n- Green contains the key.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Red: ring, Blue: coin, Green: key}$",
