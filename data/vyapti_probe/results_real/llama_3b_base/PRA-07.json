The expression (R AND S) is evaluated next. Since R = true and S = true, this expression is true. The OR operator is then applied, and since one of the expressions is true, OUT = true.\n2. The expression (P AND Q) is now false (since P = false). The expression (R AND S) is still true. The OR operator is then applied, and since one of the expressions is true, OUT = true. Therefore, OUT does not change when P is changed to false.",
