In the no Medication X group, 0 subjects improved and 3 subjects did not improve.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the proportion of subjects who improved in each group.\nIn the Medication X group, the proportion of subjects who improved is 3/3 = 1. In the no Medication X group, the proportion of subjects who improved is 0/3 = 0.\n\n## Step 4: Compare the proportions of subjects who improved in each group.\nSince the proportion of subjects who improved in the Medication X group (1) is greater than the proportion of subjects who improved in the no Medication X group (0), taking Medication X appears to be associated with symptom improvement.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
