Since the heater is currently ON, we can conclude that the temperature must be below 60\u00b0F.\n\nThis is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the condition (temp < 60) is true, and the consequence (heater ON) is also true. Since both the condition and the consequence are true, we can conclude that the temperature is indeed below 60\u00b0F.\n\nIn other words, the rule is a \"necessary condition\" for the heater to be ON. If the temperature were above 60\u00b0F, the heater would not be ON. Therefore, we can conclude that the temperature is below 60\u00b0F, given that the heater is ON.",
