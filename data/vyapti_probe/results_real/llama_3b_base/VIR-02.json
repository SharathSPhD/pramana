This can be symbolically represented as Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B).\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given information about Product P\nProduct P has passed Test-A but failed Test-B. This means Test-A is true (passed) and Test-B is false (failed).\n\n## Step 3: Apply the condition to Product P\nGiven the condition Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B), we need to evaluate \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) with Test-A being true and Test-B being false.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluate the logical expression\nSince Test-A is true and Test-B is false, the expression Test-A \u2227 Test-B is false because one of the conditions (Test-B being false) is not met. Therefore, \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true.\n\n## Step 5: Determine if Product P is rejected\nSince \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true, the condition for rejection is met. Therefore, Product P is rejected.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
