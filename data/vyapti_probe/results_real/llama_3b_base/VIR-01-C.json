  "raw_response": "The answer is: We can conclude that Student X has completed all homework assignments.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nThe rule states that if a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments. This is a conditional statement, which means that the truth of the conclusion (completed all homework assignments) follows from the truth of the premise (passed the final exam).\n\nSince we know that Student X has passed the final exam, we can apply the rule to conclude that Student X has completed all homework assignments. This is a valid application of the rule, as the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nNote that this is a simple example of a conditional statement, but it illustrates the basic principle of how to apply a rule to a specific situation. In more complex scenarios, the application of rules can involve more nuanced reasoning and analysis.",
