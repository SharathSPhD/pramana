Therefore, Q must be true.\n\nRule 2 states that if X is true AND Y is false, then Q is false. Since Y is true, rule 2 does not apply.\n\nRule 3 states that if Y is true AND X is false, then Q is false. Since X is true, rule 3 does not apply.\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditions and the rules of the logic circuit, Q must be true. \n\nHowever, the answer is 1. This is a binary logic circuit, where the output is either 0 or 1. Since Q is true, the output should be 1, not 0. \n\nThe correct answer is 1. \n\nThe problem statement is incorrect. The correct answer is 1, not 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
