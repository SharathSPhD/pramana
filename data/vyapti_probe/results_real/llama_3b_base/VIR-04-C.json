This means that if an employee is permitted to enter the restricted zone, then they must have completed the safety training. However, we are given that Employee Z is currently inside the restricted zone (they are permitted), but we do not know whether they have completed the training. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Employee Z has completed the safety training. The correct answer is \"No\". \n\nNote: This question requires the application of logical reasoning, specifically the contrapositive rule, to evaluate the given policy statement and its implications.
