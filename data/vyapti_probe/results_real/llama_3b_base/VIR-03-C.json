  "raw_response": "**Answer:** Yes, we can conclude that Student Y received a scholarship.\n**Explanation:** The given statement is a universal conditional statement, which can be written as \"If a student scored above 90, then the student received a scholarship.\" This statement is true for all students who scored above 90. Since Student Y scored 95, which is above 90, we can conclude that Student Y received a scholarship.\nThis type of argument is called a \"universal instantiation\" argument. It is a valid argument form because it is based on a universal statement and a specific instance. The conclusion follows logically from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is a specific instance of the universal statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Student Y received a scholarship.",
