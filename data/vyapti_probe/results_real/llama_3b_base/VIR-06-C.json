Therefore, it is not possible for any light in Room A to be off.\nThis means that statement (b) \"No lights in Room A are off\" MUST be true.\nHowever, it is not necessary for at least one light in Room A to be on, since the statement only asserts that all lights are on, not that there is at least one light on.\nTherefore, statement (a) \"At least one light in Room A is on\" is not necessarily true.\nThe correct answer is (b).",
