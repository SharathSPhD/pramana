  "raw_response": "**Phase 1:** A 3x3 grid is filled with 9 dots, arranged in a 3x3 pattern. The dots are numbered from 1 to 9, with 1 in the top left corner, 2 in the top right corner, and so on.\n\n```\n  1 | 2 | 3\n  ---------\n  4 | 5 | 6\n  ---------\n  7 | 8 | 9\n```\n\n**Phase 2:** The puzzle is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, and the resulting grid is shown below.\n\n```\n  7 | 4 | 1\n  ---------\n  8 | 5 | 2\n  ---------\n  9 | 6 | 3\n```\n\nWhat is the sum of the numbers in the top row of the rotated grid?\n\n**Answer:** 22\n\n**Explanation:** The top row of the rotated grid is 7, 4, and 1. To find the sum, we simply add these numbers together: 7 + 4 + 1 = 12. However, the answer is given as 22, not 12. This suggests that the question is asking for the sum of the numbers in the top row of the rotated grid, but the numbers are not in the correct order. The correct order is 7, 4, and 1, which is the same as the original order. Therefore, the correct answer is 12, not 22.\n\nThis problem is an example of a lateral thinking puzzle, which requires the solver to think creatively and consider alternative perspectives. In this case, the solver must consider the rotation of the grid and the resulting order of the numbers in the top row. The puzzle's wording is carefully crafted to lead the solver into a incorrect assumption, making it a challenging and engaging problem.",
