In other words, it does not provide a converse or inverse statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Case #247 is not high-priority simply because a senior partner is not assigned.\n\nThere may be other reasons why a senior partner is not assigned, such as the case being low-priority or the firm being busy with other cases. We cannot make a conclusion about the priority of Case #247 based on the information provided.",
