  "raw_response": "The final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$\n\nExplanation: The building inspector needs to determine whether Building Z complies with the current building code. Since Building Z was constructed in 2023, it is subject to the 2022 amendment. The amendment states that all residential buildings constructed after 2020 must have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet. Therefore, Building Z does not comply with the current building code because its ceiling height is less than the required 9 feet. The building inspector should issue a non-compliance notice to the building owner.\nThe best answer is No.",
