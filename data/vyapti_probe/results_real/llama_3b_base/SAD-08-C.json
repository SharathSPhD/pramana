  "raw_response": "The answer is: Morning, Afternoon, Evening.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nWe can use a simple greedy algorithm to solve this problem. We start by assigning the first task (T1) to the earliest available time slot, which is Morning.\n\nNext, we assign the second task (T2) to the next available time slot, which is Afternoon.\n\nFinally, we assign the third task (T3) to the last available time slot, which is Evening.\n\nThis order makes sense because T1 must be scheduled before T2, and T2 must be scheduled before T3.\n\nTherefore, the valid schedule is: Morning, Afternoon, Evening.\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other valid schedules that satisfy the constraints. However, this order is a straightforward and logical choice that meets the requirements.",
