In fact, the theorem being proved states that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, so we should assume that p is odd, not even. The correct proof would be:\n\n1. Let p be a prime number greater than 2.\n2. Assume p is even.\n3. Then p = 2k for some integer k > 1.\n4. Since p > 2 and p is even, p is divisible by 2.\n5. Since p > 2 and p is divisible by 2, p is not prime (because it has a factor other than 1 and itself).\n6. This contradicts premise 1 (p is prime).\n7. Therefore, p is not even, so p is odd. QED.\n\nHowever, this corrected proof is still not valid because it assumes that p is even in step 2, and then proceeds to prove that p is not prime if it is even. But the theorem being proved states that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, so we should assume that p is odd, not even.\n\nThe correct proof is:\n\n1.
