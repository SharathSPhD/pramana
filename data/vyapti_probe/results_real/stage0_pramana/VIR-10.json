In this case, the doubt is whether Contestant M qualifies for the prize based on the contest rule.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge for Contestant M's qualifications. According to the problem statement, Contestant M has solved BOTH Problem A and Problem B. This is our primary source of knowledge.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo determine Contestant M's qualification, we construct a 5-member syllogism:\n\n1. All contestants who solve Problem A qualify for the prize.\n2. Contestant M has solved Problem A.\n3. All contestants who solve Problem B qualify for the prize.\n4. Contestant M has solved Problem B.\n5. Contestant M has solved BOTH Problem A and Problem B.\n\nUsing the rules of syllogism, we can conclude that Contestant M qualifies for the prize.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo test our conclusion, we consider counterfactual scenarios:\n\n- What if Contestant M had only solved Problem A? Would they still qualify? (No)\n- What if Contestant M had only solved Problem B? Would they still qualify? (No)\n- What if Contestant M had not solved either Problem A or Problem B? Would they still qualify? (No)\n\nIn all cases, Contestant M's qualification is dependent on solving both Problem A and Problem B. Therefore, our conclusion is correct.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n\n- We have not assumed any additional information beyond the problem statement.\n- We have not used circular reasoning or any other fallacies.\n- Our conclusion is based on the rules of the contest and Contestant M's actions.\n\nOur reasoning is sound.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that Contestant M qualifies for the prize.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
