  "raw_response": "The final answer is: $\\boxed{(a)}$\n\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" can be analyzed by considering the possibility of doubt. We need to examine if there is any doubt about the statement. The statement does not provide information about the number of lights or their state, so there is no doubt about the statement itself.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge for this statement are the senses and the senses can be trusted. We can see the lights in Room A, and if they are on, then the statement is true. We can also see if the lights are off, and if they are off, then the statement is false.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the statement.\n\n1. All A are B (All the lights in Room A are on)\n2. B (being on) implies C (at least one light is on)\n3. C (at least one light is on) implies D (no lights are off)\n4. D (no lights are off) implies E (all lights are on)\n5. E (all lights are on) implies F (the statement is true)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to analyze the statement. If the lights in Room A were off, then the statement would be false. But we know that the lights are on, so the statement must be true.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check if the statement is a fallacy. The statement is not a fallacy because it is a universal statement that can be verified through observation.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the statement \"All the lights in Room A are on\" implies that at least one light in Room A is on. This is because if all the lights were off, then the statement would be false. Therefore, the correct answer is (a) At least one light in Room A is on.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(a)}$",
