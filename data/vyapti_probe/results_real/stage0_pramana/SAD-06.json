  "raw_response": "**Note:** The answer should be a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" indicating whether the classification is logically valid.\n\n---\n\n### Solution:\nTo determine if the classification is logically valid, we will follow the 6-phase Nyaya methodology.\n\n#### Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe analyst's classification is based on two rules:\n- Rule 1: \"An object is classified as Type-X if it has Feature-P.\"\n- Rule 2: \"Feature-P is defined as the feature possessed by all and only Type-X objects.\"\n\nWe need to examine if the analyst's conclusion logically follows from these rules.\n\n#### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe analyst's observation that Object Q has Feature-P is considered a reliable source of knowledge. This observation is based on the analyst's perception and is not subject to error.\n\n#### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nThe 5-member syllogism consists of:\n1. Premise 1: Object Q has Feature-P.\n2. Premise 2: Feature-P is defined as the feature possessed by all and only Type-X objects.\n3. Conclusion: Object Q is Type-X.\n\nWe need to evaluate if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n#### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo evaluate the validity of the syllogism, we consider counterfactual scenarios:\n- If Object Q did not have Feature-P, would it still be classified as Type-X? (No)\n- If Feature-P is not possessed by all and only Type-X objects, would Object Q still be classified as Type-X? (No)\n\nThe counterfactual scenarios suggest that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n#### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nThe classification is not based on a fallacy, such as a false syllogism or a circular definition.\n\n#### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, the classification is not logically valid. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The analyst's conclusion is based on a tautology: \"An object is classified as Type-X if it has Feature-P\" and \"Feature-P is defined as the feature possessed by all and only Type-X objects.\" These two statements are equivalent, and the classification is based on a self-referential definition. Therefore, the classification is not logically valid.\n\n**Final Answer:** no (The classification is not logically valid.)",
