We need to understand the rules governing access control and the implications of the events recorded in the log.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe log is the primary source of knowledge. It provides a chronological record of access control events. We can rely on this log to determine the sequence of events and the rules governing access control.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a syllogism to analyze the situation:\n\n1. If User A's access to Server X is granted, then User A has access to Server X (Premise 1).\n2. If User A's access to Server X is revoked, then User A does not have access to Server X (Premise 2).\n3. The log shows that User A's access to Server X was granted on Jan 1 and revoked on Mar 15 (Premise 3).\n4. Therefore, User A had access to Server X on Jan 1 and did not have access on Mar 15 (Conclusion 1).\n5. If User A had access to Server X on Feb 1, then User A should still have access to Server X on Mar 15 (Premise 4).\n6. However, the log shows that User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15 (Premise 5).\n7. Therefore, User A did not have access to Server X on Feb 1 (Conclusion 2).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the validity of our conclusions. Suppose User A had access to Server X on Feb 1. Then, User A should still have access to Server X on Mar 15. However, the log shows that User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15. This contradicts our assumption that User A had access to Server X on Feb 1. Therefore, our conclusion that User A did not have access to Server X on Feb 1 is correct.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. Our reasoning is sound, and we have avoided fallacies.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that the access control system should not have granted User A access to Server X on February 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",
