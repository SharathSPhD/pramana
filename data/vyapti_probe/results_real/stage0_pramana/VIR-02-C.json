In this case, the doubt is whether Product P is rejected or not. We need to analyze the given condition to determine the outcome.\n\nThe condition states that the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that BOTH Test-A passes AND Test-B passes. This means that if either Test-A fails or Test-B fails, the product is not rejected. However, if both tests pass, the product is rejected.\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge for this problem. In this case, the sources of knowledge are:\n\n* The condition for rejection: \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B)\n* The definition of rejection: The product is rejected if it fails both tests.\n* The definition of failure: The product fails both tests if either Test-A fails or Test-B fails.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the problem:\n\n1. All products that fail both tests are rejected.\n2. Product P fails both tests.\n3. Therefore, Product P is rejected.\n4. But the condition states that the product is rejected if it is NOT the case that BOTH Test-A passes AND Test-B passes.\n5. Since Product P fails both tests, it is the case that BOTH Test-A passes AND Test-B passes. Therefore, the product is NOT rejected.\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to analyze the problem. Suppose Test-A passes and Test-B passes. Then, the product is rejected. However, this is not the case. Therefore, the product is not rejected.\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, we have not identified any fallacies.\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Product P is NOT rejected.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
