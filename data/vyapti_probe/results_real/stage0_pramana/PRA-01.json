The goal is to determine the position of Ela. To begin, we should analyze the given constraints to identify potential sources of doubt or ambiguity.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nFrom the given constraints, we have the following sources of knowledge:\n\n1. Amit sits in position 1.\n2. Bela sits immediately to the right of Amit.\n3. Dev prefers coffee over tea.\n4. Charu sits in position 5.\n5. Ela does not sit in position 1.\n\nThese constraints provide the foundation for our reasoning.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe will construct a 5-member syllogism to deduce the position of Ela. The syllogism will consist of five premises and a conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: Amit sits in position 1.\nPremise 2: Bela sits immediately to the right of Amit.\nPremise 3: Dev prefers coffee over tea.\nPremise 4: Charu sits in position 5.\nPremise 5: Ela does not sit in position 1.\n\nConclusion: Ela sits in position 3.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe will use counterfactual reasoning to test the validity of our conclusion.\n\nCounterfactual 1: Amit sits in position 2.\nCounterfactual 2: Bela sits immediately to the right of Amit.\nCounterfactual 3: Dev prefers coffee over tea.\nCounterfactual 4: Charu sits in position 5.\nCounterfactual 5: Ela does not sit in position 1.\n\nIf we assume Counterfactual 1, then Bela would sit in position 3, and Ela would sit in position 4. However, this violates Premise 5, which states that Ela does not sit in position 1. Therefore, our conclusion is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe will check for fallacies in our reasoning.\n\nFallacy 1: False Dilemma\nThere is no false dilemma in our reasoning.\n\nFallacy 2: Begging the Question\nThere is no begging the question.\n\nFallacy 3: Appeal to Authority\nThere is no appeal to authority.\n\nFallacy 4: Ad Hominem\nThere is no ad hominem attack.\n\nFallacy 5: Strawman\nThere is no strawman fallacy.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that Ela sits in position 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
