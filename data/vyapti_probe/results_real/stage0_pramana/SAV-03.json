  "raw_response": "The final answer should be in the format: \"The final answer is: [answer]\"\n\n**Note:** The problem is designed to be solved using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology. However, the solution will be presented in a simplified format.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem involves analyzing the test results to determine if the engineer's hypothesis is valid. The hypothesis states that whenever S1 is ON, the light is ON. We need to examine the test results to identify any patterns or contradictions.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe test results provide the primary source of knowledge for this analysis. We will examine each test result to identify the values of S1, S2, and S3, as well as the corresponding state of the light.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo determine if the hypothesis is valid, we will use the 5-member syllogism:\n\n1. All instances where S1 is ON, the light is ON (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3).\n2. All instances where S1 is ON, the light is ON (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3).\n3. If S1 is ON, then the light is ON (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3).\n4. If S1 is ON, then the light is ON (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3).\n5. Therefore, if S1 is ON, then the light is ON (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to test the hypothesis. For example:\n\n* What if S1 is ON, but S2 is OFF? The light is ON (Test 3).\n* What if S1 is ON, but S3 is OFF? The light is ON (Test 2).\n* What if S1 is OFF, but S2 is ON? The light is OFF (Test 5).\n* What if S1 is OFF, but S3 is ON? The light is OFF (Test 5).\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in the reasoning. For example:\n\n* Is the hypothesis based on a false assumption? (e.g., assuming S2 and S3 have no effect on the light)\n* Are there any logical fallacies in the reasoning? (e.g., affirming the consequent)\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can determine if the hypothesis is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{The final answer is: YES}$",
