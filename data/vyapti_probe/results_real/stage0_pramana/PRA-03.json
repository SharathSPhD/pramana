We need to analyze the rules and inputs to identify any potential doubts or ambiguities.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe have the following sources of knowledge:\n- Rule 1: If X is true AND Y is true, then Q is true.\n- Rule 2: If X is true AND Y is false, then Q is false.\n- Rule 3: Z is true OR Z is false.\n- Rule 4: If Y is true AND X is false, then Q is false.\n- Given: X is true, Y is true, Z is false.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to determine the value of Q:\n1. If X is true AND Y is true, then Q is true (Rule 1).\n2. X is true (Given).\n3. Y is true (Given).\n4. Z is false (Given).\n5. Therefore, Q is true (Rule 1).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can test the validity of our conclusion by considering counterfactual scenarios:\n- If X were false, Rule 1 would be false, and Rule 2 would be true. However, this would not affect the conclusion that Q is true.\n- If Y were false, Rule 1 would be false, and Rule 2 would be true. However, this would not affect the conclusion that Q is true.\n- If Z were true, Rule 3 would be true, but this would not affect the conclusion that Q is true.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n- We have not assumed any information that is not given.\n- We have not used any fallacious reasoning, such as affirming the consequent or denying the antecedent.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{true}$",
