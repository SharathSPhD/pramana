  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Solution:\n\n**Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)**\nThe problem involves analyzing a rule proposed by a clerk regarding shipping costs for packages. The rule states that all Heavy packages cost $15 to ship. We need to verify if this rule is correct based on the given data.\n\n**Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)**\nThe data provided includes the shipping costs for all eight packages. We can use this data to analyze the rule.\n\n**Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)**\nWe will construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the rule:\n\n1. All Heavy packages have the same shipping cost ($15).\n2. All packages have the same shipping cost ($15).\n3. If all packages have the same shipping cost, then all Heavy packages have the same shipping cost ($15).\n4. All Heavy packages have the same shipping cost ($15).\n5. Therefore, the rule \"All Heavy packages cost $15 to ship\" is correct.\n\n**Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)**\nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to test the rule:\n\n- What if Package 1 was not Heavy? Would the rule still hold? (No, it would not)\n- What if Package 7 was not Light? Would the rule still hold? (No, it would not)\n- What if the shipping cost for Heavy packages was not $15? Would the rule still hold? (No, it would not)\n\n**Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)**\nWe need to check if the rule is a fallacy:\n\n- The rule is not a universal affirmative (e.g., \"All packages are Heavy\").\n- The rule is not a universal negative (e.g., \"No packages are Heavy\").\n- The rule is not a disjunctive syllogism (e.g., \"Either package is Heavy or package is not Heavy\").\n- The rule is not a false dilemma (e.g., \"Either package is Heavy or package is not Heavy\").\n\nThe rule is a universal affirmative, and it is not a fallacy.\n\n**Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)**\nBased on the analysis, we conclude that the rule \"All Heavy packages cost $15 to ship\" is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$\n\nThe rule is correct because all Heavy packages have the same shipping cost ($15), and the data supports this rule. The counterfactual scenarios and fallacy check confirm that the rule is valid. Therefore, the rule \"All Heavy packages cost $15 to ship\" is correct based on the data.",
