The problem is clear, but we need to analyze the logical implications of each clue.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge for each clue. Clue 1 is a statement of fact. Clue 2 is a conditional statement. Clue 3 is a statement of fact. Clue 4 is a conditional statement. Clue 5 is a statement of fact.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe need to construct a 5-member syllogism using the clues. Let's denote \"window\" as W and \"door\" as D.\n\n1. W \u2192 M (If the thief entered through the window, muddy footprints would be on the windowsill.)\n2. \u223cM (There are no muddy footprints on the windowsill.)\n3. D \u2192 S (If the thief entered through the door, the lock would show scratch marks.)\n4. S (The lock shows scratch marks.)\n\nWe can now construct the syllogism:\n\n1. W \u2192 M\n2. \u223cM\n3. D \u2192 S\n4. S\n\u2234 D (By modus tollens, if S is true and D \u2192 S, then D is true.)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider the counterfactuals for each possible solution. Let's consider the counterfactuals for W and D:\n\nCounterfactuals:\n\n* W: If the thief did not enter through the window, then there would be no muddy footprints on the windowsill.\n* D: If the thief did not enter through the door, then the lock would not show scratch marks.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in the reasoning. There are no fallacies in the reasoning.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the 5-member syllogism, we can conclude that the thief entered through the door.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{door}$",
