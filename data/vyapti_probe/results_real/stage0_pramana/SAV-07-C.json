We need to consider the relationships between the compounds and the reaction.\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe data provided is based on the actual results of experiments. This data is considered reliable and trustworthy.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the situation:\n\n1. All compounds containing element X are acidic.\n2. All acidic compounds undergo the reaction.\n3. Compounds \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5 contain element X.\n4. All compounds containing element X undergo the reaction.\n5. Therefore, all acidic compounds undergo the reaction.\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can test the validity of the rule by considering counterfactual scenarios:\n\n- What if there is a compound that contains element X but is not acidic? Does the rule hold?\n- What if there is a compound that is acidic but does not contain element X? Does the rule hold?\n\nIf the rule holds in both scenarios, it is likely valid. If not, it may be invalid.\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in the reasoning:\n\n- Is the rule based on a generalization from specific instances?\n- Are there any exceptions or counterexamples?\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can determine the validity of the rule.\n\nAfter analyzing the data and applying the Nyaya methodology, we can conclude that the rule is valid.\n\n```markdown\n# Final Answer\n## Valid Rule\n```\n\n\nThe final answer is: Valid Rule",
