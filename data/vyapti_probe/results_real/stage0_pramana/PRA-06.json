  "raw_response": "Please use the format specified in the instructions.\n\n### Solution:\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nTo analyze the problem, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess.\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club.\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nThe conclusion is: Can we conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus?\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe have four sources of knowledge:\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess. (Universal Affirmative)\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club. (Universal Affirmative)\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle. (Particular Affirmative)\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. (Universal Affirmative)\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism:\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess. (Universal Affirmative)\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club. (Universal Affirmative)\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle. (Particular Affirmative)\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. (Universal Affirmative)\n5. Therefore, Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus. (Universal Affirmative)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo test the validity of the syllogism, we need to consider counterfactual scenarios:\n- What if Rishi is not a member of the chess club? Then, we cannot conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n- What if Rishi does not own a bicycle? Then, we cannot conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies:\n- There is no fallacy in the syllogism.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the 5-member syllogism and the counterfactual reasoning, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
