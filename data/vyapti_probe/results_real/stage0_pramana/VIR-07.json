  "raw_response": "**Note:** Please use the format provided for your response.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe need to analyze the given statement and identify any doubts or unclear aspects. The statement is: \"If the server is overloaded OR the network is down, the backup system activates.\" We observe that the backup system has NOT activated. The doubt arises from the fact that the statement is conditional and the condition has not been met.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge that support the statement. In this case, the statement is based on the system administrator's claim. We can consider the following sources of knowledge:\n- The system administrator's expertise and experience.\n- The system's documentation and configuration.\n- The backup system's design and functionality.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe need to construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the situation. Let's assume the following:\n- Member 1: If the server is overloaded, the backup system activates.\n- Member 2: If the network is down, the backup system activates.\n- Member 3: The server is overloaded.\n- Member 4: The network is down.\n- Member 5: The backup system has not activated.\n\nWe can now construct the syllogism:\n1. If the server is overloaded, the backup system activates (Member 1).\n2. The server is overloaded (Member 3).\n3. Therefore, the backup system activates (Modus Ponens).\n4. If the network is down, the backup system activates (Member 2).\n5. The network is down (Member 4).\n6. Therefore, the backup system activates (Modus Ponens).\n7. The backup system has not activated (Member 5).\n8. Therefore, at least one of the conditions (server overloaded or network down) is false (Modus Tollens).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to test the validity of the statement. Let's assume the following:\n- Counterfactual 1: The server is overloaded, but the network is up. In this case, the backup system should activate (Member 1).\n- Counterfactual 2: The network is down, but the server is up. In this case, the backup system should activate (Member 2).\n- Counterfactual 3: The server is overloaded, and the network is down. In this case, the backup system should activate (Member 1 and Member 2).\n\nIn all counterfactual scenarios, the backup system activates. This suggests that the statement is true.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in the argument. The argument is structured as follows:\n- If A, then B (Member 1 and Member 2).\n- A (Member 3 and Member 4).\n- Therefore, B (Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens).\nThe argument is valid and free from fallacies.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWe can now make an ascertainment based on the analysis. The backup system has not activated, and at least one of the conditions (server overloaded or network down) is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the server is not overloaded, and the network is up.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{The server is not overloaded, and the network is up.}$",
