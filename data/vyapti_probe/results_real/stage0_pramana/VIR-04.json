The policy states that no employee who has not completed safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone. Employee Z has completed the safety training. We need to determine if we can conclude that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe source of knowledge in this case is the policy document, which states the rule for entering the restricted zone. Employee Z's completion of safety training is also a source of knowledge, as it is stated explicitly. We can rely on these sources to make our conclusions.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo apply the 5-member syllogism, we need to break down the problem into five parts:\n1. All employees who have not completed safety training are not permitted in the restricted zone.\n2. Employee Z has completed safety training.\n3. If an employee has not completed safety training, then the employee is not permitted in the restricted zone.\n4. Employee Z has not completed safety training (this is the negation of statement 2).\n5. If an employee has not completed safety training, then the employee is not permitted in the restricted zone.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the validity of our conclusion. Suppose Employee Z had not completed safety training. According to the policy, Employee Z would not be permitted in the restricted zone. However, we know that Employee Z has completed safety training. Therefore, we can conclude that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, we are using modus tollens (if A, then not B; not A, therefore not B) to conclude that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone. This is a valid form of reasoning. We are also using the principle of non-contradiction (A and not A cannot both be true) to conclude that Employee Z has completed safety training. This is also a valid form of reasoning.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
