The statement \"No employee who has not completed the safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone\" establishes a conditional relationship between training and permission. This is a direct statement of the policy and serves as our primary source of knowledge.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the situation:\n\n1. All employees who have completed safety training are permitted to enter the restricted zone. (Training \u2192 Permitted)\n2. Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone. (Permitted)\n3. No employee who has not completed safety training is permitted to enter the restricted zone. (\u00acTraining \u2192 \u00acPermitted)\n4. Employee Z has not completed safety training. (\u00acTraining)\n5. Therefore, Employee Z is permitted to enter the restricted zone. (Permitted)\n\nHowever, this syllogism is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that Employee Z has not completed training based on the policy statement. The policy only states that those who have not completed training are not permitted, not that those who have completed training are permitted.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo correct the syllogism, we need to consider the counterfactual: \"If Employee Z had not completed safety training, would they be permitted to enter the restricted zone?\" According to the policy, the answer is \"no.\" Therefore, we can conclude that Employee Z must have completed safety training.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. The original syllogism contained a fallacy because it incorrectly assumed that Employee Z had not completed training. Our corrected reasoning avoids this fallacy.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Employee Z has completed the safety training.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
