We need to find a valid schedule that satisfies the constraints: T1 before T2 and T2 before T3.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nOur sources of knowledge are the constraints:\n1. T1 must be scheduled before T2.\n2. T2 must be scheduled before T3.\n\nWe can use these constraints to find a valid schedule.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nLet's construct a 5-member syllogism to find a valid schedule:\n\n1. All tasks must be assigned to a time slot.\n2. T1 must be assigned to a time slot before T2.\n3. T2 must be assigned to a time slot before T3.\n4. Morning, Afternoon, and Evening are time slots.\n5. Therefore, T1 must be assigned to Morning, T2 to Afternoon, and T3 to Evening.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nLet's analyze what would happen if we assign tasks to time slots in a way that violates the constraints:\n\n* If T1 is assigned to Afternoon, T2 must be assigned to Evening, and T3 to Morning. This violates the constraint that T1 must be before T2.\n* If T2 is assigned to Morning, T3 must be assigned to Afternoon, and T1 to Evening. This violates the constraint that T2 must be before T3.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe have checked for fallacies in our reasoning. Our reasoning is sound.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that a valid schedule is:\n\nT1: Morning\nT2: Afternoon\nT3: Evening\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Morning, Afternoon, Evening}$",
