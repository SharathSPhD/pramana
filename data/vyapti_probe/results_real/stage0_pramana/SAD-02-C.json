  "raw_response": "Use the Nyaya methodology to solve this problem.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe start by analyzing the problem for any apparent contradictions or ambiguities. The problem states that X is true if and only if Y is true, and Y is true. This creates a direct relationship between X and Y, suggesting that X's truth value is dependent on Y's truth value.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe examine the sources of knowledge for X and Y. The problem does not provide explicit information about X's truth value independently of Y. However, it does state that Y is true, which is a clear statement of fact.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe construct a 5-member syllogism to reason about X and Y:\n1. Y is true (given).\n2. X is true if and only if Y is true (given).\n3. If Y is true, then X must also be true (by definition).\n4. Therefore, X is true (by modus ponens).\n5. X is true (conclusion).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe consider counterfactual scenarios to test our reasoning:\n- If Y were false, then X would also be false (by definition).\n- However, the problem states that Y is true, so we cannot have a scenario where Y is false.\n- Therefore, our reasoning is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n- There are no fallacies in our reasoning, as we have used logical rules and definitions to arrive at our conclusion.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWe have analyzed the problem using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology and have arrived at a conclusion:\nX is true.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{True}$",
