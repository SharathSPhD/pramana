The goal is to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge for this problem are:\n\n- The definition of a carnivore: An animal that primarily consumes meat.\n- The characteristics of large animals: Animals with a significant size, typically weighing over a certain threshold.\n- The classification of tigers: Tigers are members of the Felidae family and are known to be carnivores.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nThe argument can be broken down into a 5-member syllogism:\n\n1. A tiger is a carnivore (All A are B, where A = tiger, B = carnivore)\n2. All carnivores are large animals (All B are C, where B = carnivore, C = large animal)\n3. The tiger is large (All A are C, where A = tiger, C = large animal)\n4. Therefore, the tiger is a large carnivore (All A are B and C, where A = tiger, B = carnivore, C = large animal)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo test the validity of the argument, we can consider counterfactual scenarios:\n\n- If the tiger were not a carnivore, it would not be large (Premise 2 would be false)\n- If the tiger were not large, it would not be a carnivore (Premise 1 would be false)\n- If the tiger were not a large carnivore, it would not be a tiger (Conclusion would be false)\n\nThese counterfactuals suggest that the argument is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nThe argument does not contain any fallacies:\n\n- It is not an example of a false dilemma (either/or fallacy)\n- It is not an example of a false cause (post hoc ergo propter hoc)\n- It is not an example of a false analogy (equivocation)\n- It is not an example of a false syllogism (undistributed middle)\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the tiger is indeed a large carnivore.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
