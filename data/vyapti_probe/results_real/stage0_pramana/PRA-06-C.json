  "raw_response": "**Note:** Please follow the format to the letter.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nTo analyze the problem, we need to identify the premises and the conclusion. The premises are:\n1. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n2. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\nThe conclusion is:\nCan we conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus?\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge for each premise:\n1. Rishi owns a bicycle: This is a personal observation or a statement from Rishi himself.\n2. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus: This is a general statement that may be based on a survey, a rule, or a tradition.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the problem:\n1. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus (Major Premise)\n2. Rishi owns a bicycle (Minor Premise)\n3. All bicycle owners are within 5 km of the campus (Major Premise)\n4. Rishi is a bicycle owner (Minor Premise)\n5. Therefore, Rishi is within 5 km of the campus (Conclusion)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the conclusion:\nWhat if Rishi does not live within 5 km of the campus? Then, he would not be a bicycle owner, which contradicts premise 2. Therefore, Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies:\nThere are no fallacies in this argument.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that:\nRishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$",
