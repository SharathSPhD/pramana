The rule states that passing the final exam implies completing all homework assignments. We are given that Student X has passed the final exam.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge for the given rule and the information provided. The rule is a general statement, and the information provided is based on the fact that Student X has passed the final exam. We can assume that the rule is based on the school's policies and that the final exam is a reliable indicator of a student's knowledge.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the situation:\n\n1. All students who pass the final exam have completed all homework assignments. (Rule)\n2. Student X has passed the final exam. (Given)\n3. If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments. (Rule)\n4. Therefore, Student X has completed all homework assignments. (Conclusion)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the validity of the conclusion. Suppose Student X had not completed all homework assignments, but still passed the final exam. This would contradict the rule, which implies that passing the final exam requires completing all homework assignments. Therefore, our conclusion is valid.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in our reasoning. The only potential fallacy is the assumption that the rule is universally applicable. However, we can assume that the rule is based on the school's policies and that the final exam is a reliable indicator of a student's knowledge.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Student X has completed all homework assignments.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Completed all homework assignments}$",
