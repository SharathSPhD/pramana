  "raw_response": "Please follow the format instructions.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nTo analyze the problem, we need to identify any doubts or uncertainties. The given information states that every Physics student has passed the exam. However, we know that Durga studies Physics and failed the exam. This creates a doubt about the counselor's statement.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge in this problem are the statements provided:\n\n1. Arjun studies Physics and passed the exam.\n2. Bhavya studies Chemistry and passed the exam.\n3. Chirag studies Physics and passed the exam.\n4. Durga studies Physics and FAILED the exam.\n5. Emil studies Biology and passed the exam.\n6. Fatima studies Physics and passed the exam.\n7. Gopal studies Chemistry and passed the exam.\n\nThese statements provide information about the subjects and exam results for each student.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo determine if the counselor's statement is accurate, we can construct a 5-member syllogism:\n\n1. All Physics students have passed the exam (Premise 1)\n2. Hari studies Physics (Premise 2)\n3. If Hari studies Physics, then he has passed the exam (Modus Ponens)\n4. But Durga studies Physics and failed the exam (Counterfactual)\n5. Therefore, the counselor's statement is NOT accurate (Conclusion)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can also use counterfactual reasoning to test the counselor's statement. Suppose Hari studies Physics and passes the exam. This would mean that the counselor's statement is true. However, we know that Durga studies Physics and failed the exam. If the counselor's statement were true, then Durga would have also passed the exam, which is not the case.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nTo check for fallacies, we need to identify any logical errors. In this case, the counselor's statement is based on an unjustified assumption that every Physics student has passed the exam. This assumption is not supported by the given information, which states that Durga studies Physics and failed the exam.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the counselor's statement is NOT accurate. The counselor's statement is based on an unjustified assumption that every Physics student has passed the exam. However, we know that Durga studies Physics and failed the exam, which contradicts this assumption.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{False}$",
