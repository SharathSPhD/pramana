We need to analyze the implications of this statement.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe have one source of knowledge: the statement itself. We must consider all possible interpretations of this statement.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe will construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the implications of the statement.\n\n### Syllogism:\n1. All lights in Room A are on (P)\n2. It is false that all lights in Room A are on (E)\n3. Therefore, not all lights in Room A are on (T)\n4. Therefore, at least one light in Room A is off (T)\n5. Therefore, all lights in Room A are not on (T)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to test the validity of our conclusions.\n\n### Counterfactual Scenarios:\n- If all lights in Room A were off, the statement would be true, but this contradicts our assumption that the statement is false.\n- If exactly half the lights are off, the statement would be true, but this contradicts our assumption that not all lights are on.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning.\n\n### Fallacy Check:\n- Our reasoning is valid, as we have constructed a sound syllogism.\n- Our counterfactual scenarios are correct, as they contradict our assumptions.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWe have analyzed the problem using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology. We can now state our final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(b)}$",
