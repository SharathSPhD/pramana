We need to analyze the given expression OUT = (P AND Q) OR R and the given values of P, Q, and R to determine the value of OUT.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe are given the following values:\nP = true\nQ = false\nR = true\n\nWe can use these values to evaluate the expression OUT = (P AND Q) OR R.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nFirst, we evaluate the expression (P AND Q). Since Q is false, the entire expression (P AND Q) is false.\n\nNext, we evaluate the expression (P AND Q) OR R. Since (P AND Q) is false, the expression becomes false OR R. Since R is true, the expression becomes false OR true, which is true.\n\nTherefore, OUT = true.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nTo check if OUT changes when R is changed to false, we need to evaluate the expression OUT = (P AND Q) OR R with R = false.\n\nIf R = false, the expression (P AND Q) OR R becomes (P AND Q) OR false, which is (P AND Q). Since Q is false, the entire expression (P AND Q) is false.\n\nTherefore, OUT = false when R = false.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check if there are any fallacies in our reasoning.\n\nOur reasoning is correct. We have evaluated the expression OUT = (P AND Q) OR R with the given values of P, Q, and R, and we have also evaluated the expression with R = false.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n1. When P = true, Q = false, and R = true, OUT = true.\n2. When R = false (keeping all else the same), OUT = false.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{true}$ for part 1 and $\\boxed{false}$ for part 2.",
