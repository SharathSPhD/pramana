  "raw_response": "**Note:** The answer should be in the format \"Yes/No\" or \"Yes/No, with explanation\".\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe have a rule that states the heater turns on if the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F. However, we are told that the heater is currently ON. We need to analyze if we can conclude that the temperature is below 60\u00b0F based on this information.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nOur knowledge comes from the rule and the fact that the heater is ON. The rule is a valid source of knowledge, but the fact that the heater is ON is an observation that may not necessarily follow from the rule.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a syllogism as follows:\n\n1. If the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F, then the heater turns on (rule).\n2. The heater is currently ON (observation).\n3. Therefore, the temperature must be below 60\u00b0F (conclusion).\n\nHowever, this syllogism is not valid because the rule only guarantees that the heater turns on if the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F, but it does not guarantee that the temperature is below 60\u00b0F if the heater is ON.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nLet's consider a counterfactual scenario: what if the temperature is exactly 60\u00b0F? In this case, the rule would not trigger the heater to turn on, but the heater is still ON. This counterexample shows that the conclusion \"the temperature is below 60\u00b0F\" is not necessarily true.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check if there are any fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, we are not guilty of any fallacies, but we are also not justified in our conclusion.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we cannot conclude that the temperature is below 60\u00b0F. The rule only guarantees that the heater turns on if the temperature drops below 60\u00b0F, but it does not guarantee that the temperature is below 60\u00b0F if the heater is ON. Therefore, our final answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",
