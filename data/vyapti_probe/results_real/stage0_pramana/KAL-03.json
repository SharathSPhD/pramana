In this case, the doubt is whether Student A can check out the third book during the summer session.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge that will help us answer the question. In this case, the source of knowledge is the university policy.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe need to construct a 5-member syllogism to reason about the situation.\n\n### Member 1: \nAll students during summer session may check out up to 2 library books simultaneously (Pramana: University policy).\n\n### Member 2: \nStudent A is a student during summer session (Pramana: Time of semester).\n\n### Member 3: \nStudent A already has 2 books checked out (Pramana: Given information).\n\n### Member 4: \nIf Student A checks out a third book, then Student A will have 3 books checked out (Modus Ponens: If A, then B; A; \u2234 B).\n\n### Member 5: \nThe university policy states that students may check out up to 5 library books simultaneously (Pramana: University policy).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider what would happen if Student A checks out the third book. If Student A checks out the third book, then Student A will be in violation of the university policy.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, we need to check if our reasoning is based on a false assumption.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWe need to make a final decision based on our analysis.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",
