We can trust the log entries as they are part of the access control system.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to reason about the situation:\n\n1. User A was granted access to Server X on Jan 1 (Premise 1).\n2. User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15 (Premise 2).\n3. User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15 (Premise 2 implies that User A's access was revoked before Jun 1).\n4. User A attempts to access Server X on Jun 1 (Premise 3).\n5. User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15 (Premise 2 implies that User A's access was revoked before Jun 1, and User A attempts to access Server X on Jun 1).\n\nFrom the syllogism, we can conclude that User A's access to Server X was revoked before Jun 1.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can reason counterfactually to check for any potential fallacies. Suppose User A's access to Server X was not revoked on Mar 15. Then, User A would still have access to Server X on Jun 1. However, this contradicts the log entries. Therefore, User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in our reasoning. Our reasoning is sound, and we have not committed any fallacies.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that User A's access to Server X was revoked on Mar 15. Therefore, User A should not be granted access to Server X on Jun 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",
