We need to analyze the expression and the given values to determine the value of OUT.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe given values are: P = true, Q = false, R = true, S = true. We can use these values to substitute into the expression for OUT.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can break down the expression into two parts: (P AND Q) and (R AND S). We know that P = true and Q = false, so (P AND Q) = false. We also know that R = true and S = true, so (R AND S) = true.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to determine the value of OUT. If (P AND Q) = false, then OUT = (false OR (R AND S)). Since (R AND S) = true, OUT = (false OR true) = true.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check if our reasoning is free from fallacies. We have not used any fallacious reasoning.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that OUT = true.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe have been given the Boolean expression for OUT and the values of P, Q, R, and S. We need to analyze the expression and the given values to determine the value of OUT when P is changed to false.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe given values are: P = false, Q = false, R = true, S = true. We can use these values to substitute into the expression for OUT.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can break down the expression into two parts: (P AND Q) and (R AND S). We know that P = false and Q = false, so (P AND Q) = false. We also know that R = true and S = true, so (R AND S) = true.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to determine the value of OUT.
