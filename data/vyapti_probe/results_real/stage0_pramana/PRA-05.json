  "raw_response": "**Note:** The answer should be in the format \"Lab-North\" or \"Lab-South\".\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem involves four researchers and two labs, with each researcher having a favorite beverage. The given information is as follows:\n- Priya works in Lab-North.\n- Qadir works in Lab-South.\n- Ravi drinks coffee.\n- Sita works in Lab-North.\n- Priya drinks tea.\n\nWe need to analyze the given information to identify any potential doubts or inconsistencies.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nFrom the given information, we have the following sources of knowledge:\n- Direct statements: Priya works in Lab-North, Qadir works in Lab-South, Ravi drinks coffee, Sita works in Lab-North, and Priya drinks tea.\n- Inferences: We can infer that Qadir works in Lab-South because Priya works in Lab-North, and there are only two labs. Similarly, we can infer that Ravi works in Lab-North because Sita works in Lab-North.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to solve the problem:\n1. All researchers work in either Lab-North or Lab-South.\n2. Priya works in Lab-North.\n3. Qadir works in Lab-South.\n4. Ravi drinks coffee.\n5. Sita works in Lab-North.\n\nUsing the syllogism, we can conclude that:\n- If Priya works in Lab-North, then Qadir works in Lab-South.\n- If Qadir works in Lab-South, then Priya works in Lab-North.\n- If Sita works in Lab-North, then Ravi works in Lab-North.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test the possible answers:\n- If Ravi works in Lab-North, then Sita works in Lab-North, Priya works in Lab-North, and Qadir works in Lab-South. This is consistent with the given information.\n- If Ravi works in Lab-South, then Sita works in Lab-North, Priya works in Lab-North, and Qadir works in Lab-South. This is inconsistent with the given information.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in our reasoning:\n- There are no fallacies in our reasoning.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that:\nRavi works in Lab-North.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Lab-North}$",
