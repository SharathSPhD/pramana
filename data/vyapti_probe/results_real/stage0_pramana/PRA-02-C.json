  "raw_response": "**Note:** The answer should be in the format of a single sentence.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem does not present any doubts or uncertainties that need to be addressed. The premises are given, and we are to draw a valid conclusion from them.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe premises are based on the following sources of knowledge:\n1. All surgeons in this hospital have completed a residency program. (This premise is based on a general rule or universal statement.)\n2. Dr. Kapoor is a surgeon in this hospital. (This premise is based on a specific instance or particular fact.)\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo draw a valid conclusion, we need to construct a 5-member syllogism:\n1. All surgeons in this hospital have completed a residency program. (Universal Affirmative)\n2. Dr. Kapoor is a surgeon in this hospital. (Universal Affirmative)\n3. All surgeons who have completed a residency program are qualified surgeons. (Universal Affirmative)\n4. Dr. Kapoor has completed a residency program. (Universal Affirmative)\n5. Therefore, Dr. Kapoor is a qualified surgeon. (Universal Affirmative)\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider counterfactual scenarios to ensure the validity of our conclusion:\n- If Dr. Kapoor were not a surgeon in this hospital, then he would not have completed a residency program.\n- If Dr. Kapoor had not completed a residency program, then he would not be a qualified surgeon.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n- Our reasoning is based on universal affirmative premises and a valid syllogism.\n- There are no fallacies in our reasoning.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Dr. Kapoor is a qualified surgeon.\n\nThe final answer is: Dr. Kapoor is a qualified surgeon.",
