The rule states that if a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments. However, we know that Student X has NOT completed all homework assignments. This creates a doubt about whether Student X passed the final exam.\n\n### Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe rule provides a conditional statement that can be analyzed using logical rules. We have the following information:\n\n* Rule: If a student passes the final exam, then the student has completed all homework assignments.\n* Information: Student X has NOT completed all homework assignments.\n\nWe can use this information to analyze the rule and determine the student's final exam result.\n\n### Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism using the given rule and information:\n\n1. All students who pass the final exam have completed all homework assignments (Rule).\n2. Student X has NOT completed all homework assignments (Information).\n3. Therefore, Student X has NOT passed the final exam (Inference 1).\n4. If Student X had passed the final exam, then Student X would have completed all homework assignments (Rule).\n5. Therefore, Student X has NOT passed the final exam (Inference 2).\n\n### Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to analyze the situation. Suppose Student X had passed the final exam. Then, according to the rule, Student X would have completed all homework assignments. However, we know that Student X did NOT complete all homework assignments. This creates a contradiction, and we can conclude that Student X did NOT pass the final exam.\n\n### Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. Our reasoning is sound, and we have not committed any fallacies.\n\n### Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that Student X did NOT pass the final exam.\n\nThe final answer is: The final answer is: Student X did NOT pass the final exam.",
