Jun does not order pasta.\n2. Kira orders sushi.\n3. Lev does not order salad.\n\nThese are direct statements from the problem.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism using the given information:\n\n1. All people order a different dish.\n2. Kira orders sushi.\n3. Lev does not order salad.\n4. Jun does not order pasta.\n5. All dishes are ordered.\n\nWe can now construct the syllogism:\n\nAll people order a different dish.\nKira orders sushi.\n\u2234 Lev does not order salad.\nJun does not order pasta.\n\u2234 Lev does not order salad (already known).\n\u2234 Lev orders pasta.\nKira orders sushi.\n\u2234 Jun orders salad.\nJun does not order pasta.\n\u2234 Jun orders sushi.\n\u2234 Lev orders salad.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our assumptions.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the syllogism:\n\n1. All people order a different dish.\n2. Kira orders sushi.\n3. Lev does not order salad.\n4.
