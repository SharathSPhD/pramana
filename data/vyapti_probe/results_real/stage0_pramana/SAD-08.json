We notice that the constraints form a cycle: T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3. This cycle indicates that the tasks must be scheduled in a specific order.\n2.  **Pramana (Sources of Knowledge):** We use the given constraints to determine the valid schedule. The constraints imply that T1 must be scheduled before T2, T2 must be scheduled before T3, and T3 must be scheduled before T1. This information allows us to determine the correct order of tasks.\n3.  **Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism):** We use the following syllogism to derive the solution:\n\n    *   All tasks must be scheduled in a specific order.\n    *   The order is T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3.\n    *   Therefore, the valid schedule is T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening.\n4.  **Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning):** We consider alternative schedules and verify that they violate the constraints. For example, if T1 is scheduled in Afternoon, then T2 cannot be scheduled in Morning, which violates the constraint. This process ensures that the derived solution satisfies all constraints.\n5.  **Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check):** We check the solution for fallacies and ensure that it is not based on false assumptions. In this case, the solution is based on the given constraints and is free from fallacies.\n6.  **Nirnaya (Ascertainment):** We derive the final answer based on the analysis and reasoning. The valid schedule is T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{[('Morning', 'T1'), ('Afternoon', 'T2'), ('Evening', 'T3')]}$.\n\n### Note:\nThe provided Python code generates all permutations of tasks and time slots and checks if the constraints are satisfied. The code is not necessary for the solution, as the solution can be derived using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology. The code is provided for completeness and to demonstrate how the problem can be solved using Python.",
