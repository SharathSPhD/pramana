The unknown is the lab where Ravi works, and the given information includes the labs where Priya, Qadir, and Sita work, as well as the fact that Lab-South has exactly two researchers.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge are the statements provided. We can use these statements to derive conclusions.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a syllogism using the given information.\n\nLet's analyze the information:\n- Priya works in Lab-North.\n- Qadir works in Lab-South.\n- Sita works in Lab-North.\n- Lab-South has exactly two researchers.\n\nSince Lab-South has exactly two researchers, and Qadir works in Lab-South, the other researcher in Lab-South must be Ravi.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe need to consider the counterfactuals. If Ravi worked in Lab-North, then Lab-South would have only one researcher, which contradicts the given information.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies. There are no fallacies in the given information.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that Ravi works in Lab-South.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Lab-South}$",
