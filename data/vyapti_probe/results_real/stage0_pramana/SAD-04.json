  "raw_response": "**Note:** The answer should be a simple \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe need to analyze the given access control rule and the new request from User Y to understand the situation. The rule states that User X is authorized if and only if User X appears in the authorized users list. This creates a paradoxical situation where the definition of authorization is based on the list of authorized users.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge in this problem are the access control rule and the new request from User Y. We have the rule that defines authorization and the request that asks if User Y is authorized.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nTo apply the 5-member syllogism, we need to break down the problem into five parts:\n1. The authorized users list is not empty.\n2. User Y is not in the authorized users list.\n3. If User Y is in the authorized users list, then User Y is authorized.\n4. If User Y is not in the authorized users list, then User Y is not authorized.\n5. The authorized users list contains exactly those users who are authorized.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nUsing counterfactual reasoning, we can analyze the situation by asking \"what if\" questions. What if User Y is in the authorized users list? Then User Y is authorized. What if User Y is not in the authorized users list? Then User Y is not authorized.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in the reasoning. The problem statement creates a paradoxical situation where the definition of authorization is based on the list of authorized users. However, this paradox does not affect the logical analysis of the situation.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that User Y is not authorized. The authorized users list contains exactly those users who are authorized, and User Y is not in the list.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{no}$",
