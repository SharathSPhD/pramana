  "raw_response": "Do not use any external resources.\n\n### Solution:\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nWe have a conditional statement: \"Every student who scored above 90 on the test received a scholarship.\" We also know that Student Y received a scholarship. We need to analyze if we can conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nOur knowledge is based on the conditional statement and the fact that Student Y received a scholarship. We do not have any additional information about Student Y's test score.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism:\n1. All students who scored above 90 received a scholarship.\n2. Student Y received a scholarship.\n3. Therefore, Student Y must have scored above 90.\n4. But we cannot conclude that Student Y scored above 90.\n5. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Student Y received a scholarship.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can consider counterfactual scenarios:\n- What if Student Y scored exactly 90? They would still receive a scholarship.\n- What if Student Y scored below 90? They would not receive a scholarship.\nSince we know that Student Y received a scholarship, we cannot conclude that they scored above 90.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies:\n- The conditional statement is a universal conditional.\n- The conclusion is a particular conclusion.\n- The argument is valid.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nWe have analyzed the problem using the 6-phase Nyaya methodology. Based on our analysis, we cannot conclude that Student Y scored above 90 on the test.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",
