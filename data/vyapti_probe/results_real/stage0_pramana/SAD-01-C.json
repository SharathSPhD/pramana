  "raw_response": "The final answer should be in the format: \"Yes/No\" or \"Concept A/Property B\" or \"Both/Neither\".\n\n### Solution:\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem requires us to analyze the definitions of Concept A and Property B, and then determine whether Object X has Property B and is Concept A. We must consider all possible interpretations and doubts.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe have two definitions:\n- \"Concept A is defined as anything that has property B.\"\n- \"Property B is defined as having a molecular weight greater than 500 daltons.\"\nObject X has a molecular weight of 750 daltons. We can use these definitions to determine whether Object X has Property B and is Concept A.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the problem:\n1. All things that have Property B have molecular weight greater than 500 daltons (Premise 1).\n2. All things with molecular weight greater than 500 daltons have Property B (Premise 2).\n3. Object X has molecular weight greater than 500 daltons (Premise 3).\n4. Therefore, Object X has Property B (Conclusion 1).\n5. All things that have Property B are Concept A (Premise 4).\n6. Therefore, Object X is Concept A (Conclusion 2).\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to test our conclusions:\n- If Object X did not have Property B, it would not have molecular weight greater than 500 daltons (Counterfactual 1).\n- But Object X does have molecular weight greater than 500 daltons (Premise 3).\n- Therefore, Object X must have Property B (Counterfactual 2).\n- If Object X was not Concept A, it would not have Property B (Counterfactual 3).\n- But Object X does have Property B (Conclusion 1).\n- Therefore, Object X must be Concept A (Counterfactual 4).\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe must check for fallacies in our reasoning:\n- We have used valid definitions and logical rules to construct our syllogism.\n- We have tested our conclusions using counterfactual reasoning.\n- Our reasoning is free from fallacies.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that:\n- Object X has Property B, because it has molecular weight greater than 500 daltons (Conclusion 1).\n- Object X is Concept A, because it has Property B (Conclusion 2).\n\nThe final answer is: Concept A/Property B.",
