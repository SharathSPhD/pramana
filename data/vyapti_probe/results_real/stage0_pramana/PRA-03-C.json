We have three rules:\n\n1. If X is true AND Y is true, then Q is true.\n2. If X is true AND Y is false, then Q is false.\n3. If Y is true AND X is false, then Q is false.\n\nGiven: X is true, Y is true.\n\nWe need to find the value of Q.\n\n### Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe have three rules, and we know the values of X and Y. We can use these rules to find the value of Q.\n\n### Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism using the rules:\n\n1. If X is true AND Y is true, then Q is true.\n2. X is true.\n3. Y is true.\n4. X is true AND Y is true.\n5. Therefore, Q is true.\n\n### Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can test the validity of our reasoning by considering counterfactual scenarios:\n\n* If X were false, Y were true, then Q would be false (rule 2).\n* If X were true, Y were false, then Q would be false (rule 2).\n* If X were false, Y were false, then Q would be false (rule 3).\n\nHowever, our original scenario has X true and Y true. Therefore, Q must be true.\n\n### Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in our reasoning. We have:\n\n* No false dichotomies.\n* No equivocation.\n* No begging the question.\n\nOur reasoning is valid.\n\n### Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that:\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{true}$",
