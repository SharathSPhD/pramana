  "raw_response": "---\n\n### Phase 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem presents a set of statements about seven students studying different subjects and passing exams. We need to analyze the given statements for any inconsistencies or doubts.\n\nThe key statement here is \"Every Physics student in this cohort passed the exam.\" This statement seems to contradict the fact that not all Physics students passed the exam, as evidenced by the fact that Fatima, Gopal, and Arjun are all Physics students who did not pass the exam.\n\n### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nThe sources of knowledge in this problem are the set of statements provided about the students' subjects and exam results.\n\n1. Arjun studies Physics and passed the exam.\n2. Bhavya studies Chemistry and passed the exam.\n3. Chirag studies Physics and passed the exam.\n4. Durga studies Physics and passed the exam.\n5. Emil studies Biology and passed the exam.\n6. Fatima studies Physics and passed the exam.\n7. Gopal studies Chemistry and passed the exam.\n\n### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the problem:\n\n1. All Physics students passed the exam (Premise)\n2. Arjun studies Physics and passed the exam (Premise)\n3. Arjun studies Physics (Premise)\n4. Therefore, Arjun passed the exam (Modus Ponens)\n5. But Arjun did not pass the exam (Contradiction)\n\nThis syllogism reveals a contradiction between the premise \"Every Physics student passed the exam\" and the fact that Arjun did not pass the exam.\n\n### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can consider counterfactual scenarios to test the consistency of the problem:\n\n* What if all Physics students passed the exam? Then Arjun, Fatima, and Gopal would have passed the exam, which contradicts the given information.\n* What if not all Physics students passed the exam? Then the statement \"Every Physics student passed the exam\" is false, which is consistent with the given information.\n\n### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for fallacies in the reasoning:\n\n* The argument is not based on any fallacies. The contradiction arises from the inconsistency between the premise and the fact.\n* The conclusion is logically consistent with the premises.\n\n### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the department head's confirmation is inconsistent with the data. The statement \"Every Physics student in this cohort passed the exam\" is false, as evidenced by the fact that not all Physics students passed the exam.\n\n**Final Answer:** The department head's confirmation is inconsistent with the data. The statement \"Every Physics student in this cohort passed the exam\" is false.",
