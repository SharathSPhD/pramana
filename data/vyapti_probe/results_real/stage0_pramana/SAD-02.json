  "raw_response": "The final answer should be in the format \"The final answer is $\\boxed{[answer]}$.\"\n\nDo not forget to add the boxed notation to your final answer.\n\n## Step 1: Samshaya (Doubt Analysis)\nThe problem involves two variables, X and Y, with two simultaneous equations. We need to analyze the given information and identify any doubts or unclear points. In this case, the information is straightforward: X is true if and only if Y is true, and Y is true if and only if X is true.\n\n## Step 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\nWe need to identify the sources of knowledge that can help us solve the problem. In this case, the sources of knowledge are the two simultaneous equations. We can use these equations to analyze the relationship between X and Y.\n\n## Step 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\nWe can construct a 5-member syllogism to analyze the relationship between X and Y. The five members are:\n\n1. If X is true, then Y is true.\n2. If Y is true, then X is true.\n3. X is true if and only if Y is true.\n4. Y is true if and only if X is true.\n5. X and Y have the same truth value.\n\n## Step 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\nWe can use counterfactual reasoning to analyze the relationship between X and Y. If X were true, then Y would also be true. Similarly, if Y were true, then X would also be true. This suggests that X and Y have the same truth value.\n\n## Step 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\nWe need to check for any fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, there are no obvious fallacies. However, we need to be careful not to assume anything that is not explicitly stated.\n\n## Step 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that X and Y have the same truth value. Since the problem does not provide any additional information, we can conclude that X is true if and only if Y is true. Therefore, the value of X is true.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{True}$",
