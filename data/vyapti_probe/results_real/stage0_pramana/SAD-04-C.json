The rules state that a user is authorized if they appear in the authorized users list. The list currently contains Alice, Bob, and Charlie.\n\n#### Phase 2: Pramana (Sources of Knowledge)\n\nThe sources of knowledge are:\n- The access control rules\n- The authorized users list maintained by the security team\n\n#### Phase 3: Pancha Avayava (5-Member Syllogism)\n\nThe 5-member syllogism is as follows:\n1. User X is authorized if User X appears in the authorized users list.\n2. The authorized users list currently contains {Alice, Bob, Charlie}.\n3. Dana is a new user (not in the list).\n4. If User X is authorized, then User X appears in the authorized users list.\n5. Dana is not in the authorized users list.\n\nFrom 1 and 4, we can conclude that if Dana is authorized, then Dana must appear in the authorized users list.\nFrom 2 and 5, we can conclude that Dana cannot appear in the authorized users list.\nTherefore, Dana is not authorized.\n\n#### Phase 4: Tarka (Counterfactual Reasoning)\n\nCounterfactual reasoning involves considering alternative scenarios to test the validity of our reasoning. In this case, we can ask ourselves: \"What if Dana was authorized?\" If Dana was authorized, then Dana must appear in the authorized users list. However, this contradicts our conclusion that Dana is not in the list. Therefore, our reasoning is sound.\n\n#### Phase 5: Hetvabhasa (Fallacy Check)\n\nThe fallacy check involves checking for logical fallacies in our reasoning. In this case, we have not committed any logical fallacies. Our reasoning is based on the given access control rules and the authorized users list, and we have applied the 5-member syllogism correctly.\n\n#### Phase 6: Nirnaya (Ascertainment)\n\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that Dana is not authorized to access the system.\n\n**Final Answer:** Dana is not authorized.",
