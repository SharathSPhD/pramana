  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if I can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus based on the given statements. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the given information:\n\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess.\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club.\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nAnd the question is: Can we conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus?\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to see if these statements logically lead to the conclusion that Rishi is within 5 km of the campus. Let me try to visualize this with some diagrams or maybe using syllogisms.\n\nStarting with statement 1: All members of the chess club can play chess. So, if someone is in the chess club, they can play chess. That seems straightforward.\n\nStatement 2: Rishi is a member of the chess club. So, Rishi is in the chess club, which means by statement 1, Rishi can play chess. Not directly relevant, but it's part of the given.\n\nStatement 3: Rishi owns a bicycle. So, Rishi has a bicycle. Now, this is interesting because it connects Rishi to something else, which is a bicycle.\n\nStatement 4: All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus. So, if you own a bicycle, you must live within 5 km of the campus. That's a universal statement, meaning every bicycle owner is within that radius.\n\nNow, putting it all together. Rishi owns a bicycle (statement 3), and all bicycle owners live within 5 km (statement 4). So, if Rishi owns a bicycle, does that mean Rishi is within 5 km?\n\nWait, that seems like a direct conclusion. Because if all bicycle owners are within 5 km, and Rishi is a bicycle owner, then Rishi must be within 5 km. So, yes, that seems to follow.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's see.\n\nIs there any possibility that Rishi could own a bicycle but not live within 5 km? But statement 4 says all bicycle owners live within 5 km, so that's a universal statement. There are no exceptions. So, if Rishi owns a bicycle, he must be within 5 km.\n\nSo, putting it in logical terms: If R is a bicycle owner, then R lives within 5 km. Rishi is a bicycle owner (statement 3), so Rishi must live within 5 km.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is yes, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any hidden assumption here? For example, does \"owning a bicycle\" necessarily mean that the person lives somewhere? Or could Rishi be a student who commutes from home, which is within 5 km? Or is there a possibility that Rishi's bicycle is at the campus, but he lives elsewhere? Hmm.\n\nBut statement 4 says all bicycle owners live within 5 km. So, if Rishi owns a bicycle, regardless of where he keeps it, he must live within 5 km. So, even if he commutes, his residence is within 5 km. So, yes, the conclusion holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this with a Venn diagram or something. Let's see.\n\nImagine a big circle representing all people who live within 5 km of the campus. Inside that circle, there's a smaller circle representing all bicycle owners. Since all bicycle owners are within the big circle, any bicycle owner must be in the big circle. Rishi is a bicycle owner, so he must be in the big circle. Therefore, Rishi lives within 5 km.\n\nAlternatively, using syllogistic logic: All bicycle owners are within 5 km (major premise). Rishi is a bicycle owner (minor premise). Therefore, Rishi is within 5 km (conclusion). That seems valid.\n\nIs there any chance that Rishi could be an exception? But statement 4 is a universal statement, so it covers all cases. There's no mention of any exceptions or alternative possibilities. So, unless there's some hidden information not stated, Rishi must be within 5 km.\n\nWait, but let me consider the first two statements again. They talk about the chess club and playing chess. How does that relate? Maybe that's a red herring or just additional information. Since Rishi is in the chess club, he can play chess, but that doesn't directly affect whether he lives within 5 km. So, maybe those are just extra facts to make the problem more about logic with multiple statements.\n\nSo, focusing back on the relevant information: Rishi owns a bicycle, and all bicycle owners live within 5 km. So, Rishi must live within 5 km. The chess club membership is just a way to introduce Rishi into the problem.\n\nTherefore, I think the conclusion is solid. Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus based on the given statements.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- All bicycle owners live within 5 km (4).\n- Rishi is a bicycle owner (3).\n- Therefore, Rishi lives within 5 km.\n\nNo contradictions or missing links here. So, I feel confident that the answer is yes, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{Yes}\n</think>\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n1. All members of the chess club can play chess.\n2. Rishi is a member of the chess club.\n3. Rishi owns a bicycle.\n4. All bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\n- From statement 3, Rishi owns a bicycle.\n- From statement 4, all bicycle owners live within 5 km of the campus.\n- Since Rishi owns a bicycle, and all bicycle owners live within 5 km, it follows that Rishi must live within 5 km of the campus.\n\nThus, we can conclude that Rishi lives within 5 km of the campus.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{Yes}\n\\]",
