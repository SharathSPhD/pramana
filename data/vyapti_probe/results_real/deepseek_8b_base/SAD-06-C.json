  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this classification system with two rules, and I need to figure out if Object Q is classified as Type-X. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Rule 1. It says, \"An object is classified as Type-X if it has Feature-P.\" So, the main thing I need to check is whether Object Q has Feature-P. If it does, then according to Rule 1, it would be classified as Type-X. If not, then it wouldn't be classified as Type-X.\n\nNow, moving on to Rule 2. It defines Feature-P as having a surface temperature above 1000\u00b0C. So, Feature-P is directly tied to the temperature of the object. If an object's surface temperature is above 1000\u00b0C, then it has Feature-P. If it's 1000\u00b0C or below, it doesn't have Feature-P.\n\nObject Q has a surface temperature of 1200\u00b0C. Let me write that down: 1200\u00b0C. Now, I need to compare this temperature to the threshold given in Rule 2. The threshold is above 1000\u00b0C. So, is 1200\u00b0C above 1000\u00b0C? Yes, it is. 1200 is definitely higher than 1000, so that means Object Q does have Feature-P.\n\nSince Object Q has Feature-P, according to Rule 1, it should be classified as Type-X. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The rules are pretty straightforward. Rule 1 is a conditional that depends on Feature-P, and Rule 2 defines Feature-P based on temperature. There are no other rules mentioned, so I don't need to consider anything else.\n\nWait, could there be any exceptions or additional conditions? The problem doesn't mention any exceptions, so I have to assume that these two rules are the only ones in play here. So, as long as the temperature is above 1000\u00b0C, Feature-P is present, and thus Type-X classification applies.\n\nJust to double-check, if the temperature was exactly 1000\u00b0C, would it still be classified as Type-X? According to Rule 2, Feature-P is defined as above 1000\u00b0C, so 1000\u00b0C wouldn't qualify. But since Object Q is 1200\u00b0C, which is above, it does qualify.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. Object Q meets the criteria for Feature-P, so it gets classified as Type-X.\n</think>\n\nObject Q is classified as Type-X because its surface temperature of 1200\u00b0C is above 1000\u00b0C, satisfying Feature-P as defined by Rule 2. Therefore, according to Rule 1, it meets the criteria for Type-X classification.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Object Q is classified as Type-X.",
