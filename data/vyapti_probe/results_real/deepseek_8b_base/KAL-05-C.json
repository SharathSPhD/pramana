  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Building W complies with the current building code. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the original building code from 2015 says that all residential buildings must have a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. That's clear. Then, in 2022, there was an amendment. The amendment states that any residential building constructed after 2020 must have a minimum ceiling height of 9 feet. However, buildings that were constructed before 2020 are \"grandfathered\" under the original code, meaning they don't have to meet the newer 9-foot standard.\n\nNow, Building W was constructed in 2018. So, it's a residential building built after 2015 but before 2020. The ceilings in Building W are 8.5 feet high. I need to determine if this meets the current code requirements.\n\nLet me break it down. The original code requires 8 feet, so 8.5 feet is higher than that, which is good. But the amendment changes things for buildings after 2020. Since Building W was built in 2018, it's before 2020, so it's grandfathered. That means it's still subject to the original code, not the amended one.\n\nWait, but does the grandfathering apply to all aspects of the building code, or just some? The amendment specifically mentions that buildings constructed before 2020 are grandfathered under the original code. So, if the original code required 8 feet, and the building was built before 2020, it doesn't have to meet the 9-foot requirement.\n\nSo, even though 8.5 feet is higher than 8 feet, the key point is that the building was constructed before 2020. Therefore, it's not required to have 9 feet. It just needs to meet the original standard, which it does.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other requirements or if the grandfathering applies only to certain aspects. But the problem doesn't mention any other changes, so I think it's safe to assume that the grandfathering applies to the ceiling height requirement.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Building W was built in 2018, which is before 2020, so it's grandfathered. Therefore, it only needs to meet the original 8-foot ceiling requirement. Since it has 8.5 feet, which is above 8 feet, it complies with the current code.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. The key is understanding when the grandfathering applies and ensuring that the building meets the standard for its construction date.\n</think>\n\nBuilding W, constructed in 2018, is grandfathered under the original 2015 building code because it was built before 2020. Therefore, it only needs to meet the original minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. Since Building W has 8.5-foot ceilings, which exceed the required 8 feet, it complies with the current building code. \n\n**Answer:** Yes, Building W complies with the current building code.",
