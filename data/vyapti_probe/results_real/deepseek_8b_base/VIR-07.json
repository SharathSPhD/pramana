  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a system administrator says, \"If the server is overloaded OR the network is down, the backup system activates.\" But we observe that the backup system hasn't activated. The question is, what can we conclude from this?\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, I need to understand the logic behind the administrator's statement. They're using the word \"OR,\" which in logic terms is a logical OR. That means that if either of the two conditions is true, the backup system will activate. So, if the server is overloaded OR the network is down, the backup kicks in.\n\nNow, we're told that the backup system hasn't activated. So, what does that mean? Well, in logic, if the conclusion (backup not activating) is false, then the premise (either server overload or network down) must be false. Because in logic, if you have a statement like \"If A, then B,\" and B is false, then A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nSo applying that here, the statement is \"If (Server is overloaded OR Network is down), then Backup activates.\" Since the backup hasn't activated, that means the premise \"Server is overloaded OR Network is down\" must be false. Therefore, both \"Server is overloaded\" and \"Network is down\" must be false. Because in an OR statement, for the entire premise to be false, both parts have to be false. If either one was true, the entire premise would be true, and the backup would activate.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, if the network is down, regardless of the server's status, the backup should activate. Similarly, if the server is overloaded, regardless of the network, the backup should activate. So, if neither of those is happening, then the backup shouldn't activate. But in our case, the backup isn't activating, so that means both the server isn't overloaded and the network isn't down.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using truth tables. Let's see:\n\nThe statement is (A \u2228 B) \u2192 C, where A is \"Server is overloaded,\" B is \"Network is down,\" and C is \"Backup activates.\"\n\nWe know that \u00acC (Backup doesn't activate) implies \u00ac(A \u2228 B). In logic, \u00ac(A \u2228 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB. So, if the backup doesn't activate, both \u00acA and \u00acB must be true. That means the server is not overloaded and the network is not down.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the backup system hasn't activated, we can conclude that the server is not overloaded and the network is functioning normally.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the conclusion is that neither the server is overloaded nor the network is down. Therefore, both conditions are false.\n</think>\n\nThe backup system not activating implies that neither the server is overloaded nor the network is down. \n\n**Answer:** The server is not overloaded, and the network is functioning normally.",
