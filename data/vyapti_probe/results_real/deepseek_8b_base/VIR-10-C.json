  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Contestant M qualifies for the prize based on the contest rule. The rule says that to win a prize, a contestant must solve Problem A or Problem B. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the wording of the rule. It says \"must solve Problem A or Problem B.\" So, does that mean the contestant has to solve at least one of them? Or does it mean they have to solve both? I think it's the first interpretation because it uses \"or,\" which typically means one or the other, not both. So, if a contestant solves either Problem A or Problem B, they qualify.\n\nNow, looking at Contestant M's situation. They have solved Problem A but not Problem B. So, they solved one of the two required problems. According to the rule, that should be enough. They don't need to solve both; solving one is sufficient.\n\nWait, but sometimes in contests, especially with multiple problems, you might need to solve all to get the prize. But the rule here specifically says \"Problem A or Problem B,\" which implies that solving either one is enough. So, unless there's a higher requirement that isn't mentioned, like solving both with a higher difficulty or something, but the rule doesn't mention that.\n\nLet me think of it another way. If the rule was \"must solve both Problem A and Problem B,\" then Contestant M wouldn't qualify because they only solved one. But since it's an \"or,\" it's only one or the other. So, solving Problem A alone should be enough.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other interpretations. Maybe the rule is trying to say that solving either one is optional, but no, that doesn't make sense because the contestant has to do something to win. So, the contestant must solve at least one of the problems.\n\nTherefore, since Contestant M solved Problem A, they do qualify for the prize.\n</think>\n\nContestant M qualifies for the prize because the contest rule requires solving either Problem A or Problem B. Since M solved Problem A, they meet the requirement.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Contestant M qualifies for the prize.",
