  "raw_response": "Alright, so I've got this scheduling problem to solve. It involves three tasks: T1, T2, and T3. They need to be assigned to three time slots: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. The constraints are a bit tricky, though. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the constraints again to make sure I understand them correctly:\n\n1. T1 must be scheduled in the slot immediately before T2.\n2. T2 must be scheduled in the slot immediately before T3.\n3. T3 must be scheduled in the slot immediately before T1.\n\nSo, each task has to come right before the next one in a cycle. It's like a loop: T1 before T2, T2 before T3, and T3 before T1. That means all three tasks are connected in a circular manner. Hmm, that's interesting. It's not a straightforward linear sequence but a cycle.\n\nLet me think about how to visualize this. If I imagine the time slots as Morning (M), Afternoon (A), and Evening (E), each slot can hold one task. Now, the constraints form a cycle: T1 \u2192 T2 \u2192 T3 \u2192 T1. So, T1 must be in the slot right before T2, which must be right before T3, which must be right before T1. That means the order is T1, then T2, then T3, and then back to T1.\n\nBut since there are only three slots, the cycle has to fit within these three slots. Let me try to map this out.\n\nIf T1 is in the Morning slot, then T2 has to be in the slot immediately after Morning, which is Afternoon. Then, T3 must be in the slot immediately after Afternoon, which is Evening. But then, according to the third constraint, T3 must be immediately before T1. So, if T3 is in the Evening slot, the next slot after Evening would be... well, there is no slot after Evening. So, that doesn't loop back to T1. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the constraints. It says each task must be in the slot immediately before the next one. So, if T1 is before T2, T2 is before T3, and T3 is before T1. So, it's a cycle where each task is both preceded and succeeded by another task.\n\nBut with only three slots, how can this cycle fit? Let me try assigning the tasks step by step.\n\nLet's denote the slots as M, A, E.\n\nLet me try assigning T1 to M. Then, T2 must be in the slot immediately after M, which is A. Then, T3 must be in the slot immediately after A, which is E. But now, T3 is in E, and according to the third constraint, T3 must be immediately before T1. But after E, there's no slot, so T1 can't be scheduled after E. That doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T1 is in A. Then, T2 must be in E. Then, T3 must be in... wait, after E, there's no slot, so T3 can't be scheduled. That doesn't work either.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the cycle wraps around. So, if T3 is in E, then the next slot after E is M. So, T1 would be in M, which is the slot immediately after E. So, that could work.\n\nLet me write this out:\n\n- T1 is in M.\n- T2 must be in the slot immediately after M, which is A.\n- T3 must be in the slot immediately after A, which is E.\n- Then, T3 must be immediately before T1, which would mean T1 is in the slot after E. But after E, the next slot is M, which is where T1 is. So, that works.\n\nSo, the assignments would be:\n\n- M: T1\n- A: T2\n- E: T3\n\nLet me check the constraints:\n\n1. T1 is in M, T2 is in A. Yes, M is immediately before A.\n2. T2 is in A, T3 is in E. Yes, A is immediately before E.\n3. T3 is in E, T1 is in M. Wait, E is immediately before M? No, because after E comes M, but E is the last slot. So, is E immediately before M? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the slot immediately before T1.\" So, if T3 is in E, then the slot immediately before T1 must be E. So, T1 must be in the slot after E, which is M. So, yes, that works.\n\nSo, in this case, the schedule would be:\n\n- Morning: T1\n- Afternoon: T2\n- Evening: T3\n\nLet me visualize this as a cycle:\n\nT1 (M) \u2192 T2 (A) \u2192 T3 (E) \u2192 T1 (M)\n\nYes, that loops back correctly. Each task is immediately before the next one, and the last one loops back to the first.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another arrangement? Let me see.\n\nSuppose T1 is in A. Then, T2 must be in E. Then, T3 must be in M. Then, T3 must be immediately before T1, which is in A. But M is before A, so T3 in M is before T1 in A. That works as well.\n\nSo, another possible schedule:\n\n- Morning: T3\n- Afternoon: T1\n- Evening: T2\n\nChecking the constraints:\n\n1. T1 is in A, T2 is in E. A is before E.\n2. T2 is in E, T3 is in M. Wait, E is before M? No, because after E comes M, but E is the last slot. So, is E immediately before M? Yes, in a cyclic sense.\n\nBut hold on, the third constraint says T3 must be in the slot immediately before T1. So, T3 is in M, and T1 is in A. Is M immediately before A? Yes, because M is the slot before A.\n\nSo, that also works.\n\nSimilarly, if T1 is in E, then T2 must be in M, and T3 must be in A. Let's check:\n\n1. T1 is in E, T2 is in M. E is immediately before M.\n2. T2 is in M, T3 is in A. M is immediately before A.\n3. T3 is in A, T1 is in E. A is immediately before E.\n\nYes, that also works.\n\nSo, actually, there are three possible valid schedules, depending on which slot T1 is assigned to.\n\nWait, but the problem just asks to \"find a valid schedule,\" not necessarily all possible schedules. So, any one of these would work.\n\nBut let me double-check each possibility to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst schedule:\n\n- M: T1\n- A: T2\n- E: T3\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. T1 before T2: M before A \u2013 correct.\n2. T2 before T3: A before E \u2013 correct.\n3. T3 before T1: E before M \u2013 correct in a cyclic sense.\n\nSecond schedule:\n\n- M: T3\n- A: T1\n- E: T2\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. T1 before T2: A before E \u2013 correct.\n2. T2 before T3: E before M \u2013 correct in a cyclic sense.\n3. T3 before T1: M before A \u2013 correct.\n\nThird schedule:\n\n- M: T2\n- A: T3\n- E: T1\n\nWait, hold on. If T1 is in E, then T2 must be in M, but in this case, T2 is in M. Let me check the constraints:\n\n1. T1 before T2: E before M \u2013 correct.\n2. T2 before T3: M before A \u2013 correct.\n3. T3 before T1: A before E \u2013 correct.\n\nYes, that also works.\n\nWait, so actually, there are three possible valid schedules, each starting with a different task in a different slot.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any preferences or constraints beyond the cyclic dependencies. So, any of these would be acceptable.\n\nHowever, the problem might be expecting a specific answer, perhaps the one where T1 is in the morning. But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a particular order, but since it's a cycle, all three are equivalent in terms of the constraints. So, perhaps any one of them is acceptable.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me write down all three possibilities.\n\n1. T1: M, T2: A, T3: E\n2. T1: A, T2: E, T3: M\n3. T1: E, T2: M, T3: A\n\nEach of these satisfies all three constraints.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"a valid schedule,\" so any one of these would be correct. However, sometimes in scheduling problems, the order is considered from earliest to latest, so starting with Morning, then Afternoon, then Evening.\n\nIn that case, the first schedule would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting the order T1, T2, T3 in the sequence M, A, E. So, that would be the first schedule.\n\nBut to confirm, let me check the constraints again for the first schedule:\n\n- T1 is in M, T2 in A:",
