  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the given proof that \u221a2 is irrational is valid. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the proof starts by assuming the opposite of what it's trying to prove. That is, it assumes that \u221a2 is rational. That makes sense because in proofs of irrationality, we often use proof by contradiction. So, if we can show that assuming \u221a2 is rational leads to a contradiction, then \u221a2 must be irrational. So, step 1 seems okay.\n\nStep 2 says that if \u221a2 is rational, then \u221a2 can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors. That's the standard way to represent a rational number in simplest terms. So, step 2 is also fine.\n\nStep 3 then squares both sides of the equation \u221a2 = p/q to get 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2. That's a valid operation because squaring both sides preserves the equality. So, step 3 is correct.\n\nIn step 4, it says that p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2. So, from 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2, multiplying both sides by q\u00b2 gives p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2. That makes sense. So, step 4 is okay.\n\nStep 5 states that p\u00b2 is even, so p must be even. Hmm, wait a second. If p\u00b2 is even, does that necessarily mean p is even? Let me think. Yes, because if a square is even, then the number itself must be even. Because an even number times an even number is even, and an odd number times an odd number is odd. So, if p\u00b2 is even, p has to be even. So, step 5 is correct.\n\nThen, step 6 says that if p is even, let p = 2k. That substitution is fine because if p is even, we can express it as 2 times some integer k. So, step 6 is okay.\n\nSubstituting p = 2k into the equation p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, we get (2k)\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, which simplifies to 4k\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2. Dividing both sides by 2 gives 2k\u00b2 = q\u00b2. So, step 7 is correct.\n\nStep 8 then says that q\u00b2 is even, so q must be even. Similar to step 5, if q\u00b2 is even, then q is even. Because if q were odd, q\u00b2 would be odd. So, step 8 is correct.\n\nNow, step 9 points out that if both p and q are even, they share a common factor of 2. That makes sense because if p = 2k and q = 2m (for some integers k and m), then both p and q are divisible by 2. Therefore, they have a common factor, which contradicts step 1 where p and q were said to have no common factors. So, step 9 is correct.\n\nFinally, step 10 concludes that the assumption that \u221a2 is rational leads to a contradiction, so \u221a2 must be irrational. That's the conclusion of the proof by contradiction, so step 10 is valid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, starting from the beginning:\n\n1. Assume \u221a2 is rational.\n2. Express \u221a2 as p/q in lowest terms.\n3. Square both sides to get 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2.\n4. Multiply both sides by q\u00b2: p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2.\n5. Since p\u00b2 is even, p must be even. Let p = 2k.\n6. Substitute p into equation: (2k)\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2 => 4k\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2 => 2k\u00b2 = q\u00b2.\n7. Since q\u00b2 is even, q must be even. Let q = 2m.\n8. Now, p = 2k and q = 2m, so both are even, which contradicts the initial assumption that p and q have no common factors.\n9. Therefore, the original assumption is false, so \u221a2 is irrational.\n\nYes, that all seems to check out. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and there are no gaps or errors in the reasoning. The proof is classic and is a well-known proof for the irrationality of \u221a2.\n\nI don't see any issues here. Each step is justified, and the contradiction is clear. So, the proof is valid.\n**Final Answer**\nThe proof is valid. \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} \\text{ is irrational}}\n</think>\n\nThe proof starts by assuming the opposite of what it's trying to prove, which is a common method in proof by contradiction. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. Assume \u221a2 is rational. Then \u221a2 can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors.\n2. Squaring both sides gives 2 = p\u00b2/q\u00b2, leading to p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2.\n3. Since p\u00b2 is even, p must be even. Let p = 2k.\n4. Substituting p = 2k into the equation gives 4k\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2, simplifying to 2k\u00b2 = q\u00b2.\n5. Since q\u00b2 is even, q must be even. Let q = 2m.\n6. Both p and q being even means they share a common factor of 2, contradicting the initial assumption that p and q have no common factors.\n\nThis contradiction implies that the original assumption is false, so \u221a2 must be irrational.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{2} \\text{ is irrational}}\n\\]",
