  "raw_response": "Alright, so I have this problem about students in a body, and I need to figure out which students must attend study hall. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given information:\n\n- Set A is the set of students who play sports. The members of Set A are p, q, r, s, t. So, that's five students.\n  \n- Set B is the set of students who are on the honor roll. The members here are q, r, u, v. So, four students.\n\nNow, the policy says: \"Students who play sports AND are NOT on the honor roll must attend study hall.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find the students who are in Set A (play sports) but not in Set B (not on the honor roll). That makes sense because the policy is specifically about those who play sports and aren't on the honor roll.\n\nLet me write down the sets again for clarity.\n\nSet A = {p, q, r, s, t}\nSet B = {q, r, u, v}\n\nSo, I need to find the intersection of Set A and the complement of Set B. In other words, students who are in Set A but not in Set B.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\n\nSet A \u2229 (Set B') = ?\n\nSet B' is the complement of Set B, which means all students not in Set B. Since the total student body isn't specified, I'll assume it's the union of Set A and Set B. So, the total students are p, q, r, s, t, u, v. That's seven students.\n\nTherefore, Set B' would be all students not in Set B. So, Set B is {q, r, u, v}, so Set B' is {p, s, t}.\n\nWait, let me check that. If Set B is {q, r, u, v}, then the complement Set B' would exclude these four. So, the remaining students are p, s, t. That's correct.\n\nSo, Set A is {p, q, r, s, t}, and Set B' is {p, s, t}. So, the intersection of these two sets is the students who play sports and are not on the honor roll.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nSet A \u2229 Set B' = {p, s, t}\n\nSo, these three students must attend study hall.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each student in Set A and see if they are in Set B or not.\n\n- p: Is p in Set B? Set B is {q, r, u, v}, so no. So, p is in Set A and not in Set B. So, p must attend study hall.\n\n- q: Is q in Set B? Yes, q is in Set B. So, q is in both Set A and Set B. The policy doesn't apply here because it's about those who play sports AND are NOT on the honor roll. So, q is exempt.\n\n- r: Is r in Set B? Yes, r is on the honor roll. So, r is in both sets. Exempt.\n\n- s: Is s in Set B? No, s is not listed in Set B. So, s is in Set A and not in Set B. Must attend study hall.\n\n- t: Is t in Set B? No, t is not listed in Set B. So, t is in Set A and not in Set B. Must attend study hall.\n\nSo, that gives us p, s, t. That's three students.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there a possibility that the total student body is larger? The problem doesn't specify, but it gives us two sets, A and B. So, unless there are students not in either A or B, but the policy is about students in A but not in B. So, even if there are other students not in A or B, the policy doesn't affect them.\n\nTherefore, the only students required to attend study hall are those in Set A but not in Set B, which are p, s, t.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n- Students who play sports: p, q, r, s, t.\n\n- Students on honor roll: q, r, u, v.\n\n- So, subtract the honor roll students from the sports players: remove q and r, leaving p, s, t.\n\nTherefore, p, s, t must attend study hall.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. It seems straightforward once you break it down into sets and their complements.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe students who must attend study hall are \\boxed{p, s, t}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to determine which students must attend study hall based on the policy: \"Students who play sports AND are NOT on the honor roll must attend study hall.\"\n\nFirst, we identify the sets:\n- Set A (students who play sports) = {p, q, r, s, t}\n- Set B (students who are on the honor roll) = {q, r, u, v}\n\nWe need to find the students who are in Set A but not in Set B. This is equivalent to finding the intersection of Set A and the complement of Set B (Set B').\n\nThe complement of Set B (Set B') consists of all students not in Set B. Since Set B is {q, r, u, v}, the complement Set B' is {p, s, t}.\n\nNext, we compute the intersection of Set A and Set B':\n- Set A \u2229 Set B' = {p, s, t}\n\nThus, the students who must attend study hall are p, s, and t.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p, s, t}\n\\]",
