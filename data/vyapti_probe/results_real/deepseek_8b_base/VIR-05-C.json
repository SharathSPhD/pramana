  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem about students and sets, and I need to figure out which students are eligible for the athletics scholarship. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. There are two sets, Set A and Set B. Set A consists of students who play sports, and the members are p, q, r, s, t. Set B consists of students who are on the honor roll, and the members are q, r, u, v. The policy says that students who both play sports and are on the honor roll are eligible for the scholarship. So, I need to find the intersection of Set A and Set B because that's where both conditions are met.\n\nAlright, so Set A is {p, q, r, s, t}, and Set B is {q, r, u, v}. To find the intersection, I should look for the common elements in both sets. Let me list out the elements:\n\nSet A: p, q, r, s, t\nSet B: q, r, u, v\n\nLooking at these, I can see that both sets have q and r. So, the intersection should be {q, r}. That means both q and r play sports and are on the honor roll, so they meet the criteria for the scholarship.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Set A has five students, and Set B has four. The overlap is only two students, q and r. The other students in Set A are p, s, t, who aren't in Set B, and in Set B, u and v aren't in Set A. So, yeah, only q and r are common to both.\n\nIs there a chance that maybe someone else is in both sets? Let me go through each letter again. Set A: p, q, r, s, t. Set B: q, r, u, v. No, p, s, t aren't in Set B, and u, v aren't in Set A. So, no, only q and r are in both.\n\nTherefore, the eligible students are q and r. I think that's it. It seems straightforward because it's just about finding common elements between two sets based on the given conditions.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't misinterpret the policy: It says \"Students who play sports AND are on the honor roll...\" So, it's an AND condition, meaning both things have to be true. So, it's definitely the intersection, not the union or anything else.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is q and r.\n**Final Answer**\nThe students eligible for the athletics scholarship are \\boxed{q} and \\boxed{r}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which students are eligible for the athletics scholarship, we need to find the intersection of Set A and Set B. \n\n- Set A (students who play sports) = {p, q, r, s, t}\n- Set B (students who are on the honor roll) = {q, r, u, v}\n\nThe intersection of Set A and Set B consists of the common elements in both sets. \n\n- The common elements in both sets are q and r.\n\nTherefore, the students eligible for the athletics scholarship are \\boxed{q} and \\boxed{r}.",
