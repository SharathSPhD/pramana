  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Product P is rejected based on the quality control system's criteria. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the system rejects a product if it's NOT the case that both Test-A and Test-B pass. So, in logical terms, that would be: Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). \n\nNow, Product P has failed both Test-A and Test-B. So, Test-A did not pass, and Test-B also did not pass. Let me represent that as \u00acTest-A and \u00acTest-B.\n\nI remember from logic that the negation of an AND statement is the OR of the negations. So, \u00ac(A \u2227 B) is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB. That means if either Test-A fails or Test-B fails, the product is rejected.\n\nIn this case, both Test-A and Test-B have failed. So, \u00acTest-A is true, and \u00acTest-B is also true. Therefore, \u00acTest-A \u2228 \u00acTest-B becomes true because either one is true, and the OR makes the whole statement true.\n\nSince the system rejects the product if \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true, and we've established that \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is true because both tests failed, that means the product should be rejected.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If both tests fail, then both \u00acTest-A and \u00acTest-B are true. Using De Morgan's Law, \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B) is indeed \u00acTest-A \u2228 \u00acTest-B, which is true because both parts are true. So, the product is rejected.\n\nI think that's right. So, yes, Product P is rejected because both tests failed, making the condition for rejection true.\n</think>\n\nThe quality control system rejects a product if it fails either Test-A or Test-B. Since Product P has failed both tests, it meets the rejection condition.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Product P is rejected.",
