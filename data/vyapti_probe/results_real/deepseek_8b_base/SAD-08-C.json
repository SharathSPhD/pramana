  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to assign three tasks\u2014T1, T2, and T3\u2014to three different time slots: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. The constraints are that T1 must be scheduled before T2, and T2 must be scheduled before T3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the possible ways to assign the tasks to the time slots without any constraints. Since there are three tasks and three time slots, the number of permutations is 3 factorial, which is 6. So, the possible schedules are:\n\n1. T1 - Morning, T2 - Afternoon, T3 - Evening\n2. T1 - Morning, T2 - Evening, T3 - Afternoon\n3. T1 - Afternoon, T2 - Morning, T3 - Evening\n4. T1 - Afternoon, T2 - Evening, T3 - Morning\n5. T1 - Evening, T2 - Morning, T3 - Afternoon\n6. T1 - Evening, T2 - Afternoon, T3 - Morning\n\nNow, I need to check which of these schedules satisfy the constraints T1 before T2 and T2 before T3. Let's go through each one.\n\n1. T1 - Morning, T2 - Afternoon, T3 - Evening: Here, T1 is before T2, and T2 is before T3. So, this schedule works.\n\n2. T1 - Morning, T2 - Evening, T3 - Afternoon: T1 is before T2, but T2 is not before T3 because Evening comes after Afternoon. So, this doesn't work.\n\n3. T1 - Afternoon, T2 - Morning, T3 - Evening: T1 is after T2, which violates the first constraint. So, this is out.\n\n4. T1 - Afternoon, T2 - Evening, T3 - Morning: T1 is after T2, which again violates the first constraint. Not good.\n\n5. T1 - Evening, T2 - Morning, T3 - Afternoon: T1 is after T2, violating the first constraint. So, nope.\n\n6. T1 - Evening, T2 - Afternoon, T3 - Morning: T1 is after T2, which is bad. So, this doesn't work either.\n\nWait, so only the first schedule works? That seems a bit restrictive. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the first schedule: Morning has T1, Afternoon has T2, Evening has T3. So, T1 is before T2, and T2 is before T3. Perfect.\n\nIn the second schedule: T1 is Morning, T2 is Evening, T3 is Afternoon. So, T2 is Evening, which is after T3's Afternoon. So, T2 isn't before T3, which breaks the second constraint.\n\nThird schedule: T1 is Afternoon, so T2 is Morning, which is before. So, T1 is after T2. Not allowed.\n\nFourth schedule: T1 is Afternoon, T2 is Evening, T3 is Morning. Again, T1 is after T2, which is not allowed.\n\nFifth schedule: T1 is Evening, T2 is Morning, which is before. So, T1 is after T2. Not allowed.\n\nSixth schedule: T1 is Evening, T2 is Afternoon, T3 is Morning. T1 is after T2, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, yeah, only the first schedule meets both constraints. So, the valid schedule is T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening.\n\nWait, but is there another way? Maybe I missed something. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the time slots as three positions: 1 (Morning), 2 (Afternoon), 3 (Evening). The constraints are that T1 must come before T2, and T2 must come before T3. So, in terms of positions, T1 must be in a lower-numbered slot than T2, and T2 must be in a lower-numbered slot than T3.\n\nSo, if I represent the tasks as numbers, T1=1, T2=2, T3=3, and assign them to positions 1, 2, 3 with the constraints 1<2<3. So, the only possible assignment is 1\u21921, 2\u21922, 3\u21923. So, that's the same as the first schedule.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the tasks as needing to be in increasing order across the time slots, then the only way is to have T1 in the earliest slot, T2 in the middle, and T3 in the latest.\n\nSo, yeah, that makes sense. There's only one valid schedule that satisfies both constraints. So, the answer is T1 in Morning, T2 in Afternoon, and T3 in Evening.\n</think>\n\nThe valid schedule is:\n\n- **T1** in the Morning,\n- **T2** in the Afternoon,\n- **T3** in the Evening.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that T1 is before T2 and T2 is before T3, satisfying both constraints.",
