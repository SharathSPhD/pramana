  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this theorem-proving system, and it's trying to prove that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. Let me go through the proof step by step to see if it's valid.\n\nFirst, the proof starts by letting p be a prime number greater than 2. That makes sense because primes are numbers greater than 1, and we're focusing on those greater than 2 specifically.\n\nNext, it assumes that p is even. So, p = 2k for some integer k > 1. Hmm, okay, so if p is even, it can be expressed as 2 times another integer. That seems straightforward.\n\nThen, it says since p = 2k, p is divisible by 2. Well, if p is 2 times something, then yes, it's divisible by 2. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the next step says since p > 2 and p is divisible by 2, p is not prime because it has a factor other than 1 and itself. Wait, is that correct? If p is divisible by 2, then 2 is a factor of p. But if p is greater than 2, then 2 is a proper divisor, meaning p is composite. So, that makes sense because primes have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. If p is divisible by 2 and p > 2, then it can't be prime. So, that part checks out.\n\nThen, the proof says this contradicts premise 1, which is that p is prime. So, if p is prime, but we've just shown that p can't be prime because it's divisible by 2, that's a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that p is even must be false.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that p cannot be even, which means p must be odd. Therefore, all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd. That seems logical.\n\nBut wait, let me think deeper. Is there any prime number greater than 2 that's even? Well, 2 itself is prime, but it's the only even prime. So, primes greater than 2 are all odd. So, the proof is correct in that sense.\n\nIs there any flaw in the reasoning? Let me check each step again.\n\n1. Let p be a prime number greater than 2. \u2013 Clear premise.\n2. Assume p is even. \u2013 This is the only even prime, which is 2, but since p > 2, p can't be 2. So, p being even implies it's composite. \u2013 Correct.\n3. Since p = 2k, p is divisible by 2. \u2013 Yes, that's the definition of even.\n4. Since p > 2 and p is divisible by 2, p is not prime. \u2013 Because it would have factors other than 1 and itself, so it's composite. \u2013 Correct.\n5. Contradiction because p was assumed to be prime. \u2013 So, the assumption that p is even leads to a contradiction. \u2013 Therefore, p cannot be even. \u2013 So, p must be odd. \u2013 Correct.\n\nI don't see any logical errors here. The proof uses a proof by contradiction, which is a valid method in mathematics. It assumes the opposite of what it wants to prove and shows that this leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.\n\nIs there any alternative way to think about this? Maybe considering the definition of prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, if a number is even and greater than 2, it must be divisible by 2, which means it has at least one more divisor besides 1 and itself, making it composite. Therefore, it can't be prime.\n\nSo, yeah, the proof seems solid. It doesn't skip any steps, and each step logically follows from the previous one. The contradiction is clearly shown, and the conclusion is reached without any ambiguity.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The proof is valid.\n**Final Answer**\nThe proof is valid. \\boxed{All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.}\n</think>\n\nThe proof attempt is valid. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let \\( p \\) be a prime number greater than 2.\n2. Assume \\( p \\) is even. Then \\( p = 2k \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\).\n3. Since \\( p = 2k \\), \\( p \\) is divisible by 2.\n4. Since \\( p > 2 \\) and \\( p \\) is divisible by 2, \\( p \\) is not prime (because it has a factor other than 1 and itself).\n5. This contradicts the premise that \\( p \\) is prime.\n6. Therefore, \\( p \\) cannot be even, so \\( p \\) must be odd.\n\nThe proof uses a proof by contradiction, which is a valid method in mathematics. It assumes the opposite of what it wants to prove and shows that this leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{All prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.}\n\\]",
