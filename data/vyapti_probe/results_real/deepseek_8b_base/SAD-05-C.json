  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this recursive formula here, and I need to figure out what f(4) is. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. \n\nFirst, the formula is defined recursively, which means each value of f(n) depends on the previous value f(n-1). The base case is given as f(1) = 1. Then, for any n greater than 1, f(n) is equal to f(n-1) plus n. So, to find f(4), I need to compute f(2), f(3), and then f(4) based on these previous values.\n\nLet me write down the given information:\n\n- f(1) = 1\n- For n > 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + n\n\nAlright, so starting with n=1, f(1) is 1. Now, let's move on to n=2.\n\nFor n=2, according to the formula, f(2) = f(2-1) + 2. That simplifies to f(1) + 2. Since f(1) is 1, that means f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nOkay, so f(2) is 3. Now, moving on to n=3. Using the same formula, f(3) = f(3-1) + 3, which is f(2) + 3. We already found that f(2) is 3, so f(3) = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nGreat, so f(3) is 6. Now, finally, we need to find f(4). Using the formula again, f(4) = f(4-1) + 4, which is f(3) + 4. We just calculated that f(3) is 6, so f(4) = 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Starting from f(1):\n\n- f(1) = 1\n- f(2) = f(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n- f(3) = f(2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n- f(4) = f(3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, I'm just adding the current n to the previous value. So, f(4) is 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about what this sequence looks like. Starting from 1, each term is the sum of all the integers from 1 up to n. Wait, is that right? Let me see:\n\n- f(1) = 1, which is 1\n- f(2) = 1 + 2 = 3\n- f(3) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n- f(4) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n\nOh! So f(n) is actually the sum of the first n natural numbers. That makes sense because each term is built by adding the next integer. So, the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n + 1)/2. Let me check that:\n\nFor n=1: 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1, which matches f(1).\nFor n=2: 2(2 + 1)/2 = 2*3/2 = 3, which matches f(2).\nFor n=3: 3(3 + 1)/2 = 3*4/2 = 6, which matches f(3).\nFor n=4: 4(4 + 1)/2 = 4*5/2 = 10, which matches f(4).\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that f(4) is indeed 10. This recursive formula is essentially building up the sum of integers, and the closed-form formula for that sum is n(n + 1)/2. So, plugging in 4, we get 10.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step builds on the previous one, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that f(4) is 10.\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(4) \\) is \\boxed{10}.\n</think>\n\nThe problem defines a recursive formula for \\( f(n) \\) as follows:\n- \\( f(1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(n) = f(n-1) + n \\) for \\( n > 1 \\)\n\nTo find \\( f(4) \\), we start by calculating the previous values step by step:\n\n1. For \\( n = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(1) = 1\n   \\]\n\n2. For \\( n = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(2) = f(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. For \\( n = 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(3) = f(2) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. For \\( n = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(4) = f(3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10\n   \\]\n\nWe can also recognize that \\( f(n) \\) is the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, which is given by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). For \\( n = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(4) = \\frac{4(4 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(4) \\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",
