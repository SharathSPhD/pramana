  "raw_response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if Product P is rejected based on the quality control system's condition. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the condition for rejection is: \"The product is rejected if it is NOT the case that BOTH Test-A passes AND Test-B passes.\" In symbolic terms, that's Rejected \u2194 \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, the product gets rejected when it's not true that both Test-A and Test-B have passed. That means if either Test-A fails, or Test-B fails, or both, the product is rejected.\n\nNow, the specific situation given is that Product P has passed Test-A but failed Test-B. So, Test-A is true (since it passed), and Test-B is false (since it failed). Let me write that down:\n\nTest-A = True\nTest-B = False\n\nThe condition for rejection is \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). Let me compute the inner part first: Test-A \u2227 Test-B. Since Test-A is true and Test-B is false, the conjunction (AND) of true and false is false. So, Test-A \u2227 Test-B = False.\n\nThen, the negation of that, \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B), is \u00acFalse, which is True. So, the condition for rejection is true in this case.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the symbols correctly. The rejection condition is \u00ac(Test-A \u2227 Test-B). So, if Test-A and Test-B both pass, the product is not rejected. But if either fails, it is rejected. So, if Test-A passes and Test-B fails, which is our case, then Test-A \u2227 Test-B is False, so \u00ac(False) is True, meaning the product is rejected.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in plain English. The system says the product is rejected if it's not the case that both tests pass. So, if both pass, it's accepted. If either fails, it's rejected. Since in this case, Test-B failed, regardless of Test-A passing, the product is rejected.\n\nLet me double-check my logic. The condition is a double negative: \u00ac(A \u2227 B). Which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 \u00acB (by De Morgan's laws). So, if either Test-A fails (\u00acA) or Test-B fails (\u00acB), the product is rejected. Since in our case, Test-B failed, \u00acB is true, so the product is rejected.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, even though Test-A passed, because Test-B failed, the product is rejected.\n</think>\n\nThe product is rejected because it failed Test-B, making the condition for rejection true.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Product P is rejected.",
