  "raw_response": "Okay, so I have this problem with two variables, X and Y. The problem says:\n\n- X is true if and only if Y is true.\n- Y is true.\n\nAnd I need to find the value of X. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each statement means. The first statement says, \"X is true if and only if Y is true.\" In logic terms, this is a biconditional statement, which can be written as X \u2194 Y. This means that X and Y have the same truth value; they are either both true or both false. So, if X is true, Y must also be true, and if X is false, Y must also be false.\n\nThe second statement says, \"Y is true.\" So, Y is definitely true. Now, since X is true if and only if Y is true, and we know Y is true, that should mean X is also true. Let me write that out:\n\n1. From the second statement, Y is true. So, Y = True.\n2. From the first statement, X \u2194 Y. Since Y is true, X must also be true. So, X = True.\n\nWait, is there any other way to interpret this? Could X be false? If X were false, then according to the first statement, Y would also have to be false. But the second statement says Y is true. That's a contradiction because Y can't be both true and false at the same time. So, X can't be false. Therefore, X must be true.\n\nLet me think about it another way. Maybe using truth tables would help. Let's list all possible truth values for X and Y.\n\nCase 1: X = True, Y = True\n- Does X \u2194 Y hold? Yes, because both are true.\n- Does Y = True? Yes.\n\nCase 2: X = True, Y = False\n- Does X \u2194 Y hold? No, because X is true and Y is false.\n- Does Y = True? No.\n\nCase 3: X = False, Y = True\n- Does X \u2194 Y hold? No, because X is false and Y is true.\n- Does Y = True? Yes.\n\nCase 4: X = False, Y = False\n- Does X \u2194 Y hold? Yes, because both are false.\n- Does Y = True? No.\n\nNow, the second statement says Y is true, so we can eliminate Cases 2 and 4 because in both of those Y is false. That leaves us with Cases 1 and 3. But in Case 3, X is false while Y is true, which violates the first statement (X \u2194 Y). Therefore, Case 3 is invalid. So, the only valid case is Case 1, where both X and Y are true.\n\nTherefore, X must be true.\n\nI think that's solid. There's no way around it because Y is given as true, and the first statement ties X's truth value directly to Y's. So, X has to be true as well.\n</think>\n\nThe value of X is **True**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Statements:**\n   - **First Statement:** X is true if and only if Y is true. (Symbolically, X \u2194 Y)\n   - **Second Statement:** Y is true. (Y = True)\n\n2. **Analyze the First Statement:**\n   - The biconditional (X \u2194 Y) means both X and Y have the same truth value.\n   - If Y is true, X must also be true.\n\n3. **Apply the Second Statement:**\n   - Since Y is given as true, substitute into the biconditional.\n   - Therefore, X must be true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There's no contradiction or alternative; X must be true.\n\n**Answer:** X is true.",
