**Yes, creating Inference Endpoints will charge your payment method**. Inference Endpoints are **NOT the same as Serverless API** - they are completely different services with different pricing models. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)

## Key Distinction

**Serverless Inference API** (free tier available):
- Uses Hugging Face's shared infrastructure [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- Free tier: Rate-limited but no charges [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- PRO: $9/month subscription includes higher limits [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- **Your models are NOT available on serverless** (the 404 errors confirm this) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)

**Inference Endpoints** (always paid):
- Dedicated infrastructure running YOUR model 24/7 [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- Billed per hour based on GPU instance type [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- Example pricing: A10G small instance = ~$0.60-1.00/hour = ~$432-720/month [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- **This is what you tried to create** - and yes, it requires payment [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)

## What Happened in Your Code

The error `Payment method required for namespace qbz506` means:
- You attempted to create **paid Inference Endpoints** [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- HF blocked it because you haven't added a credit card [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- If you add payment and create those endpoints, **you will be charged hourly** [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)

## Your Actual Options

Since your models (`unsloth/llama-3.2-3b-instruct` and `qbz506/nyaya-llama-3b-stage0-full`) are **not available on the Serverless API** (404 errors):

**Option 1: Space Hardware (recommended for demo)**
- Use **ZeroGPU** (free with PRO subscription ~$9/month with student discount) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-zerogpu)
- Load models directly in your Space code [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-zerogpu)
- No per-hour GPU charges beyond the PRO subscription [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-zerogpu)

**Option 2: Paid Endpoints**
- Create dedicated endpoints (~$500-700/month for two instances) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- Only worth it for production with consistent high traffic [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)

**Option 3: CPU Basic (free but very slow)**
- Load models on CPU in your Space [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview)
- Completely free but inference will be extremely slow [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview)

## Recommendation

**Do NOT create Inference Endpoints unless you need production-grade availability and have budget**. For your demo, use **ZeroGPU Space** instead - it's designed exactly for this use case and costs only the PRO subscription (~$8-9/month, less with student discount).
