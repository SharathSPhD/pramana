To make W&B part of your fine-tuning process rather than a post-hoc comparison tool, you need to integrate W&B logging directly into your training code so metrics are tracked in real-time as your model trains. This involves initializing a W&B run at the start of training and adding `wandb.log()` calls inside your training loop to capture metrics like loss and accuracy at each step or epoch. [docs.wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/sweeps/add-w-and-b-to-your-code)

## Basic Integration Steps

The core integration requires three main components in your training script: [blog.paperspace](https://blog.paperspace.com/weights-biases-with-gradient/)

1. **Initialize W&B** - At the beginning of your script, call `wandb.init(project="your-project-name", config=hyperparameters)` to start a run and pass your hyperparameters [docs.wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/sweeps/add-w-and-b-to-your-code)
2. **Log metrics during training** - Inside your training loop, add `wandb.log({"train/loss": loss, "train/accuracy": accuracy})` after each batch or epoch to send metrics in real-time [theaisummer](https://theaisummer.com/weights-and-biases-tutorial/)
3. **Finish the run** - Call `wandb.finish()` at the end of training to mark the run as complete [docs.wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/sweeps/add-w-and-b-to-your-code)

## Example Training Loop Integration

Here's how you integrate W&B into a typical PyTorch training loop: [theaisummer](https://theaisummer.com/weights-and-biases-tutorial/)

```python
import wandb

# Initialize run with config
wandb.init(project="fine-tuning", config={
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "epochs": 10,
    "batch_size": 32
})

for epoch in range(config.epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(trainloader):
        # Your training code
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        # Log training metrics
        wandb.log({"train/loss": loss.item()})
    
    # Log validation metrics at end of epoch
    val_loss, val_acc = validate(model, val_loader)
    wandb.log({"val/loss": val_loss, "val/accuracy": val_acc, "epoch": epoch})

wandb.finish()
```

## Real-Time Monitoring Benefits

With this integration, metrics appear in the W&B dashboard immediately as training progresses, allowing you to monitor training loss curves, spot overfitting early, and compare multiple fine-tuning experiments side-by-side in real-time. W&B's recent performance improvements enable logging of up to one million metrics per second with minimal overhead, ensuring the tracking doesn't slow down your training. You can also use `wandb.watch(model)` to automatically log gradients and model parameters during training, and set `log_model="all"` to save model checkpoints as artifacts throughout the process.
