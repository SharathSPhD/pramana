The answer is **A) Pure constraint satisfaction** for Stage Zero, but with a critical refinement that makes it more rigorous than just "Zebra-puzzle style." Let me explain why, then show you exactly which 5 problems to create.

## Why Pure Constraint Satisfaction for Stage Zero

**The Core Hypothesis You're Testing**:
Can an LLM learn to apply the six-phase Nyaya methodology systematically, or will it just memorize superficial patterns?

Constraint satisfaction problems are the **perfect empirical test** because:

1. **Cleanest Nyaya-to-problem mapping**: The six phases map naturally:
   - **Samshaya**: "Which assignment satisfies all constraints?" - clear Samana Dharma Upapatti (multiple possibilities share similar properties)
   - **Pramana**: Pratyaksha = given constraints, Anumana = logical elimination, Shabda = universal logical principles
   - **Pancha Avayava**: Each elimination step is a perfect syllogism
   - **Tarka**: Reductio ad absurdum is literally how constraint satisfaction works
   - **Hetvabhasa**: Easy to demonstrate circular reasoning or contradictory constraints
   - **Nirnaya**: Definitive answer exists and is verifiable

2. **Deterministic verification**: Unlike "debugging scenarios" or "causal reasoning," you know with 100% certainty if the answer is correct. No ambiguity means clean training signal.

3. **Scalable complexity within one domain**: You can test if the model learned the *methodology* by varying:
   - Number of variables (3 → 4 → 5)
   - Number of constraints (5 → 10 → 25)
   - Constraint type (direct assignment vs. relational vs. negative)

4. **Minimal domain knowledge required**: The model doesn't need to know physics, programming, or causal inference. Pure logical reasoning. This isolates the Nyaya structure learning from content knowledge.

5. **Z3 verification is straightforward**: You'll need this for Stage Two anyway. Starting with CSPs means you can build your autoformalization pipeline early.

## Why NOT the Other Options (For Stage Zero)

**Option B (Mixed logic problems)**: Boolean SAT is harder to express clearly in natural language. "If (A OR B) AND (NOT C OR D) then..." gets syntactically complex fast. You want your first 5 examples to be crystal clear so the model learns the structure without fighting linguistic ambiguity.

**Option C (Real-world reasoning)**: "Debug this code" or "What caused the bug?" have multiple valid answers, subjective reasoning paths, and require programming knowledge. This confounds structure learning with domain knowledge and answer ambiguity. Save this for Stage Two when you're testing generalization.

**Option D (Tiered complexity)**: This is **almost right**, but you're missing something crucial about Stage Zero. You don't need to test scaling yet - that's Stage One with 50 examples. You need to test **structural learnability** at the simplest meaningful level first.

## The Refined Strategy: Structured Diversity Within CSPs

Here are the **exact 5 problems** you should create, in order:

### Problem 1: Three Variables, Direct Constraints (Warmup)
**Purpose**: Establish baseline - can the model follow the six phases at all?

```
Three people (Alice, Bob, Carol) each have one pet (cat, dog, fish).
Constraints:
1. Alice doesn't have a cat
2. Bob has a dog
3. Carol doesn't have a fish

Question: Who has which pet?
```

**Why this works**: 
- Trivially simple (you can solve in your head)
- All constraints are direct assignments or negations
- Only 6 possible assignments, most immediately ruled out
- Perfect for demonstrating Purvavat Anumana (cause → effect inference)

**Nyaya teaching point**: Pratyaksha provides direct observables. Anumana through elimination. Single Pancha Avayava syllogism needed.

### Problem 2: Three Variables, Relational Constraints
**Purpose**: Introduce comparative reasoning

```
Three students (Dan, Eve, Frank) finished a race in positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
Constraints:
1. Dan finished before Eve
2. Frank did not finish last
3. Eve finished before someone

Question: What order did they finish?
```

**Why this works**:
- Same number of variables as Problem 1
- But requires understanding "before/after" relationships
- Tests if model can handle Samanyatodrishta Anumana (transitive inference)
- Multiple valid reasoning paths exist

**Nyaya teaching point**: Upamana - comparing to known orderings. Tarka - "if Eve were first, then..."

### Problem 3: Four Variables, Mixed Constraints (Complexity Jump)
**Purpose**: Test if structure scales to harder problems

```
Four houses (1, 2, 3, 4) on a street each have a color (red, blue, green, yellow).
Constraints:
1. The red house is immediately left of the blue house
2. The green house is not next to the blue house
3. House 1 is not red
4. House 4 is yellow

Question: What is the color of each house?
```

**Why this works**:
- 4! = 24 possible assignments → more complex search space
- Spatial reasoning ("immediately left," "next to")
- Mix of positive and negative constraints
- Requires multiple Pancha Avayava chains

**Nyaya teaching point**: Sequential elimination through multiple syllogisms. Hetvabhasa check - avoiding circular reasoning when eliminating possibilities.

### Problem 4: Four Variables, Negative Constraints (Fallacy Testing)
**Purpose**: Test Hetvabhasa detection capabilities

```
Four friends (Grace, Henry, Iris, Jack) each speak one language (French, German, Spanish, Italian).
Constraints:
1. Grace doesn't speak French
2. The person who speaks German is not Henry
3. Iris doesn't speak Spanish
4. Jack doesn't speak Italian
5. Grace doesn't speak German

Question: Who speaks which language?
```

**Why this works**:
- ALL negative constraints (unusual!)
- Easy to make Viruddha fallacy (contradictory reasoning)
- Requires careful tracking to avoid Sadhyasama (circular reasoning)
- Multiple valid reasoning paths, testing systematic elimination

**Nyaya teaching point**: When you only know what things are NOT, systematic elimination is critical. Tarka becomes essential.

### Problem 5: Classic Zebra-Style (Integration Test)
**Purpose**: Prove the methodology works on a genuinely difficult problem

```
Five houses in a row, each with a different color, owner nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette brand.

Constraints:
1. The Englishman lives in the red house
2. The Spaniard owns a dog
3. Coffee is drunk in the green house
4. The Ukrainian drinks tea
5. The green house is immediately right of the ivory house
6. The person who smokes Old Gold owns snails
7. The person in the yellow house smokes Kools
8. Milk is drunk in the middle house
9. The Norwegian lives in the first house
10. The person who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the person with a fox
11. The person who smokes Kools lives next to the house with a horse
12. The person who smokes Lucky Strikes drinks orange juice
13. The Japanese smokes Parliaments
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house

Question: Who owns the zebra? Who drinks water?
```

**Why this is your capstone example**:
- This is the actual Einstein Zebra puzzle
- 5 variables × 5 options = 3,125 possible states before constraints
- Requires 10+ Pancha Avayava syllogisms
- Multiple Pramana types essential
- Clear demonstration of systematic vs. trial-and-error reasoning

**Nyaya teaching point**: Complex problems require disciplined methodology. This is where Nyaya's systematic approach provides genuine advantage over random search.

## What This Problem Set Proves

If a model fine-tuned on these 5 examples can produce valid Nyaya-structured reasoning on a **6th** constraint satisfaction problem it's never seen, you've validated three critical hypotheses:

1. **Structure is learnable**: The six-phase format isn't too complex for LLMs to internalize
2. **Methodology transfers**: The model applies Nyaya reasoning to new problems, not just memorizing solutions
3. **Scaling works**: If it handles the Zebra puzzle correctly, the approach works for realistic complexity

## Stage Zero Success Criteria (Revised)

**Primary Metric**: On a held-out 6th constraint satisfaction problem:
- 80%+ of responses contain all six Nyaya phases in correct order
- 60%+ of responses reach the correct answer
- 90%+ of responses show at least 3 valid Pancha Avayava syllogisms

**Secondary Metric**: 
- Zero instances of abandoning Nyaya structure mid-solution
- Clear distinction between Pratyaksha (given constraints) and Anumana (inferred facts)
- At least one Tarka counterfactual in 70%+ of responses

**Failure Criteria** (pivot required):
- Model produces generic chain-of-thought instead of Nyaya structure
- Structural adherence <50% on held-out example
- Model reaches correct answer via non-Nyaya reasoning

## Why This Sets Up Stage One Perfectly

Once you prove Stage Zero works, your Stage One expansion becomes:

**Constraint Satisfaction (25 examples)**:
- 10 three-variable problems (establish baseline)
- 10 four-variable problems (standard difficulty)
- 5 five-variable problems (Zebra-style)

**Boolean SAT (15 examples)**:
- Now you can introduce propositional logic
- CSP foundation makes SAT easier to learn
- Tests Nyaya methodology on different formalism

**Simple Multi-step Deduction (10 examples)**:
- "All X are Y, Some Y are Z, therefore..."
- Validates Pancha Avayava on syllogistic reasoning
- Bridge to broader logical reasoning

## Practical Implementation Note

When you create these 5 examples, **you're also creating your evaluation template**. For each problem, document:

1. **Expected Samshaya type**: Which of the 5 Samshaya categories applies
2. **Required Pramanas**: Which knowledge sources must be invoked
3. **Minimum Pancha Avayava count**: How many syllogistic steps needed
4. **Fallacy opportunities**: Where Hetvabhasa could occur
5. **Z3 formalization**: How to express this in SMT-LIB

This documentation becomes your evaluation rubric for all future examples.

## The Answer

**Pure constraint satisfaction (Option A)**, but with **structured complexity progression** (2 simple, 2 moderate, 1 complex Zebra). 

Don't mix problem types in Stage Zero. Master one domain first, then generalize. This is Nyaya epistemology applied to your own research methodology: establish valid Pramana (proof of concept) before attempting Nirnaya (broad generalization).

Start with Problem 1 tomorrow. By the end of next week, you should have all 5 examples completed with full Nyaya solutions. Then you can run your first training experiment and discover if 2,500 years of Indian logic can teach modern AI to reason systematically.
