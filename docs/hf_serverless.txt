You're asking about two **different architectures** for hosting your model demo. Let me clarify the key differences and how to use Serverless Inference API:

## Space Hardware vs Serverless Inference API

**Space Hardware** (what you're seeing in settings):
- Your Space app runs continuously on dedicated hardware (CPU/GPU) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview)
- You host the model **inside** your Space [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-gpus)
- Billed per minute the Space is running [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-gpus)
- Good for: Custom UI, complex logic, full control [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-overview)

**Serverless Inference API** (alternative approach):
- Your Space makes **API calls** to Hugging Face's hosted models [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- Models run on shared infrastructure, no Space hardware needed [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- Free tier with rate limits (hundreds of requests/hour); PRO gets higher limits [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- Good for: Simple demos, testing, lower traffic [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)

## How to Use Serverless Inference API in Your Space

Instead of loading the model in your Space, you call the API from your Gradio code: [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)

```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient
import gradio as gr

# Initialize client with your token
client = InferenceClient(token="your_hf_token_here")

def generate_text(user_input):
    # Call the serverless API
    response = client.text_generation(
        prompt=user_input,
        model="qbz506/your-finetuned-model",  # Your fine-tuned model
        max_new_tokens=100,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response

# Create Gradio interface
demo = gr.Interface(fn=generate_text, inputs="text", outputs="text")
demo.launch()
```

With this approach, your Space can run on **CPU basic (free)** since it's just making API calls, not loading the model. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)

## Which is Better for Your Case?

**Use Serverless Inference API if:**
- You're testing/demoing with low-to-moderate traffic [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- You want completely free hosting (CPU basic Space + free API calls) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)
- Your model is compatible with the Serverless API (check if it loads on the Hub)

**Use Space Hardware (ZeroGPU) if:**
- You need guaranteed availability and faster response times [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- You have high traffic or need custom inference logic [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
- The Serverless API doesn't support your model or you hit rate limits [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api)

For your Llama 3.2-3B fine-tuned model demo, I'd **recommend starting with Serverless Inference API** since it's completely free and requires no Space hardware upgrades. Only upgrade to ZeroGPU if you hit rate limits or need better performance. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_dedicated_endpoints)
