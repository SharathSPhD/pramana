Hugging Face Spaces is a platform that allows you to host and deploy machine learning demo applications directly on your profile or organization's profile. Yes, Spaces is exactly where you can run demos of your fine-tuned models and compare them with base models. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)

## What is Hugging Face Spaces

Hugging Face Spaces is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to facilitate creating, sharing, and deploying machine learning models. The platform handles the infrastructure automatically, making your models scalable and accessible without requiring you to manage servers. It supports popular frameworks including Gradio, Streamlit, and Docker, allowing you to build interactive web applications with minimal code.

## Using Spaces for Model Comparison

Spaces is ideal for deploying demos of fine-tuned models alongside base models for comparison. You can create an interactive interface where users can test both versions side-by-side, making it easy to demonstrate improvements from your fine-tuning work. The platform provides free hosting with the option to upgrade for faster inference if needed. [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces)

## How to Build a Demo

### Creating Your Space

1. Log into your Hugging Face account and click "Create a new Space" on the dashboard [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)
2. Select your framework (Gradio, Streamlit, or Docker) [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)
3. Enter a name and description for your space [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)
4. Set visibility to public or private [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)

### Building with Gradio

Gradio is the simplest option for ML demos. Create an `app.py` file with your interface code: [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)

```python
import gradio as gr

def predict(input_text):
    # Your model inference code here
    return "Prediction: " + input_text

iface = gr.Interface(fn=predict, inputs="text", outputs="text")
iface.launch()
```

Add a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies like PyTorch and transformers. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDZ3tq0heBc)

### Building with Streamlit

Streamlit offers more customization for complex interfaces. Create your `app.py`: [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces)

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title('Model Comparison Demo')
user_input = st.text_input("Enter text")
# Add your model comparison logic here
```

After committing these files to your Space's repository, the app automatically builds and deploys. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDZ3tq0heBc)
